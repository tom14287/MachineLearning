appli for grant now













he, old boi! you ar forget poniatowski's red lancer, the cuirassi, the dragoon, and the whole boil. whenev napoleon grew tire of see hi battalion gain no ground toward the end of a victori, he would sai to murat, 'here, you! cut them in two for me!' and we set out first at a trot, and then at a gallop, /on, two/! and cut a wai clean through the rank of the enemi; it wa like slice an appl in two with a knife. why, a charg of cavalri is noth more nor less than a column of cannon ball.  no, no! mr. mallet cri. to bring him back voluntarili, that he mai face hi trial like a man!  mr. batchgrew, for the second time that morn unequ to a situat, turn foolishli to the wardrob, clear hi throat and snort. she took madam hulot's hand and befor the ladi could do anyth to hinder her, she kiss it respectfulli, even humbl herself to bend on knee. then she rose, as proud as when she stood on the stage in the part of _mathild_, and rang the bell.  'ti imposs! 'ti a wild tale, though god know i wish it were true, becaus he wa a fine and gallant lad.  not a prank.
