readi for thi?

the next five month could determin whether 
tivo, the person video record servic,
ultim surviv as a busi.

tivo, which launch five year ago, ha less 
than 500,000 subscrib. the compani's stock
dip below three thi week. and network exec
ar openli question whether the digit record,
which permit skip commerci with a few 
click of the remot, will destroi their advertis
model. there even have been hint that the 
network could support a move by the cabl 
industri to offer a pvr that doe not permit
commerci skip. and that pvr would not 
be a tivo. 

to it credit, tivo ha been remark success 
at build brand loyalti and awar. tivo 
report that 97 percent of it subscrib have
recommend the servic to a friend. and when
peopl talk about pvr, thei sai tivo. (just 
like the wai peopl sai "coke" when thei talk
about soft drink. )

but wall street, the media and the industri 
ar all grow impati. tivo need to start
put some big number on the board -- 
and it need to do it thi holidai season. if 
it doesn't, stock analyst who have support tivo 
until now will run for the hill. that will push
the compani's stock price down even further. and
if that happen, tivo could have just two choic:
sell the compani under duress or wait until it 
fund dri up. 

consequ, i predict that tivo will launch 
an intens market blitz over the next 
five month, right through the holidai season.
the blitz will includ a sharp increas in 
retail distribut, tv advertis and pr 
effort. the compani need to show wall 
street -- and the industri -- that it will be 
the brand leader in the pvr categori. and it
need to show that it can gener
mass consum demand. 

how doe tivo demonstr that?

anyth short of 750,000 sub at year's end
will have peopl question whether tivo ha
the right stuff. cabl exec, who ar watch
tivo close, might decid that ad the 
servic is not such a great sell point 
after all. and echostar, which current doe
not have an agreement with tivo, mai decid
to stai with it unbrand pvr servic after 
it merger with directv is approv in d.c. 
(tivo current ha a partnership with directv,
but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if 
the merger is approv.) 

so there is much at stake -- and it's not extrem
to sai that tivo's ultim futur could be decid
in the next sever month. 

will it succe? i predict that tivo will achiev
a partial success. the compani will boost it 
subscrib number and it will maintain it claim
as the #1 pvr servic. howev, in time, i 
also predict it will decid to sell the compani
to a larg media outfit, such as soni or perhap
even liberti media. thi would give tivo the 
necessari fund and industri connect
for long-term growth and surviv.
