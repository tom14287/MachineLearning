xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthank you for your interest!

judgment cours offer an extens train
cours in "how to collect moneyjudg"

if you ar like mani peopl, you ar not even sure what a
monei judgment is and why process monei judgment
can earn you veri substanti incom .

if you ever sue a compani or a person and you win then you
will have a monei judgment against them.

you ar happi you won but you will soon find out the
shock fact: "it now up to you to collect on the
judgment". the court doe not requir the loser to pai you.
the court will not even help you. you must trace the loser
down, find their asset, their employ, bank account,
real estat, stock and bond, etc.

veri few peopl know how to find these asset or what to do
when thei ar found. the result is that million of
judgment ar just sit in file and be forgotten.

"in 79% of the case the winner of a judgment never see a
dime."

the non-payment of judici debt ha grown to epidem
proport. right now in the unit state there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollar of uncollectedmonei
judgment debt . for everi judgment that is paid, 5more
judgment take it place.

we identifi thi massiv market 8 year ago and have
activ pursu judici judgment sinc. we invent thi
busi. we have perfect it into a well proven and solid
profess in which onli a select few will be train in the
techniqu necessari to succe.

with our first hand experi we have built a cours which
teach you how to start your busi in thi new unknown
and excit field of process monei judgment.

by follow the step laid out in our cours and with
reason effort you can becom veri success in the
process of monei judgment.

the incom potenti is substanti in thi profess. we
have associ who have taken our cours and ar now
work full time make $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. part time associ ar earn between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . some choos to operateout of
their home and work by themselv. other build a sizabl
organ of 15 to 25 peopl in attract busi
offic.

todai our compani and our associ have over 126
million dollar in monei judgment that we ar current
process. of thi 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventur between our firm and our associ.
joint ventur ar where we make our monei. we onli break
even when our cours is purchas. we make a 12% margin on
the report we suppli to our associ. our report
capabl is so extens that govern agenc, polic
offic, attornei, credit agenc etc., all come to us
for report.


mani of our associ alreadi have real estat lien in
forc of between 5 million to over 15 million dollar.
legal thi mean that when the properti ar sold or
refinanc our associ must be paid off. the norm is 10%
interest compound annual on unpaid monei judgment.
annual interest on 5 million at 10% translat to
$500,000.00 annual in interest incom, not count the
payment of the princip.

our associ earn half of thi amount or $250,000.00 per
year. thi is just for interest, not count principl
and not count the compound of the interest which can
add substanti addit incom. typic compani ar
sold for 10 time earn. just base on simpl interest
an associ with 5 million in real estat lien could sell
their busi for approxim 2.5 million dollar.

92% of all of our associ work out of their home; 43%
ar women and 36% ar part time .

on of the benefit of work in thi field is that you ar
not under ani kind of time frame. if you decid to take off
for a month on vacat then go. the judgment you ar
work on will be there when you return. the judgment
ar still in forc, thei do not disappear.

the wai we train you is non-confront. you us your
comput and telephon to do most of the process. you
never confront the debtor. the debtor doesn't know who you
ar. you ar not a collect agenc.

simpli state the step to success monei process
ar as follow:

mail our recommend letter to compani and individu
with monei judgment. (we train you how to find out who
to write to)

8% to 11% of the firm and peopl you write will call you
and ask for your help. thei call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.

you send them an agreement (suppli in the cours) to
sign which split everi dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. thi appli no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.

you then go on-line to our comput to find the debtor
and their asset. we offer over 120 power report to
assist you. thei rang from credit report from all three
credit bureau, to bank account locat, employ
locat, skip trace and locat stock and bond, etc.
the price of our report ar veri low. typic 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firm charg. for exampl we charg
$6.00 for an individu credit report when some other
compani charg $25.00.

onc you find the debtor and their asset you file
garnish and lien on the asset you have locat.
(standard fill in the blank form ar includ in the
cours)

when you receiv the asset you keep 50% and send 50% to
the origin judgment holder.

onc the judgment is fulli paid you mail a satisfact of
judgment to the court. (includ in the cours)
