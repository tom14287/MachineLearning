stonei mahonei
**************************

in regard to the introduct of stonei mahonei (tm) "person choic" smoke substanti product, we have strive for year to develop a consumm "sensit/respons" (loos-leaf) smoke product, "amsterdam cup" style so to speak!

with acquir knowledg via the develop of such notabl "person choic" smokeabl, as wizard smoke (tm), dream smoke (tm), dragon smoke (tm), vajroli mudra (tm), stashish (tm), shemhamphorash (tm), yerba lena yesca (tm), weedé (tm), kathmandu templ kiff (tm) 1 & 2 & 3, which for the most part have been proprietari formul, of which the right have been sold to other less aggress, less development compani, we arriv at the lofti "person choic" smoke statu of our premier ragga dagga (tm) solid pipe-smoke product.  

after all of thi, we had come to the technolog and philosoph point of view that we could not conjur a loos-leaf formul that would provid effectu that would be more signific than that of our much-herald ragga dagga (tm) solid-format pipe smoke product.  mostli, we were right about thi, as thi new stonei mahonei "agenda" is not so much signific as in "better", but "signatur signific" as in "uniqu," in that we chanc upon a new world class, botan sourc for the rare "true-brid" varieti of artemisia absinthum (flower top onli), which at on time in histori wa distil into "absinth," a greenish, anise flavor liqueur which herald certain euphor and narcot attribut which ultim result in it be declar illeg.  as well, we have final perfect our exclus "kiffen" techniqu, which inspir and establish alkaloid and glycosid potenti (enhanc) on a molecular level.  henc, we introduc (although suppli is limit) thi highli "potenti" stonei mahonei (tm) smoke product! loos-leaf "person choic" doesn’t get ani "sweeter" than thi!
