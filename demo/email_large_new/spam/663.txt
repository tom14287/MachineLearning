still look for a hous?my name is jeremi lessari. i'm look for invest properti in the midwest. the issu i've been have is that not everi everyon deal with the properti i'm look for. you know the hous that you ar almost sure will not sell; mayb thei're realli ugli or need a lot of work or ar in a bad neighborhood. but for what ever reason, the hous just don't sell.

i need those hous...

most of the agent i've dealt with were hesit becaus there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. howev, the privat investor i work with us "unconvent" privat fund so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approv. in fact most case we just pai cash and close in a week. i am pre-qualifi with greentre fund for up to $900,000 for a purchas monei mortgag base on a non-owner occupi loan at 90% ltv.  (and of cours you get your full commiss.) 

i'm not a licens real estat agent nor am i affili with ani real estat firm, which mean i can work with you just about ani wai you want. pleas don't be under the impress that we have to pai under market valu to be interest. sometim i can even pai retail price. the onli guarante i'll make is that i will not wast your time, and in most case i can tell you over the phone whether i'm interest or not. 

if you ar look to purchac a project home from our inventori or would like inform on form an allianc with  syntelig properti, pleas contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremi@syntelig.com 

best wish,
