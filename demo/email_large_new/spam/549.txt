wall street's dirti littl secret ...it wa the spring of 1979.  

i wa just a tall, goofi look kid in middl school
with buck-teeth and freckl.  each dai in the
cafeteria, i walk from tabl to tabl ...

steal other kid' lunch monei.

no, i didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made
them a littl deal.  "let me borrow two dollar todai," i said,
"and i'll bring you five dollar next week."  the invest
wa too good to pass up, and other kid were throw their
lunch monei at me like gravi on mash potato.  of cours 
when "next week" roll around and i couldn't poni up the cash,
i promis to pai them even more the week after that,
if thei would just let me keep their invest a littl bit 
longer.

eventu the end of the year came and went, high school
start and with it came girl, and homework, and parti,
and sport, and those poor kid from eighth grade had more 
thing on their mind than last year's lunch monei.

i made off with a tidi sum for a middl school kid,
and i didn't even get beat up.

hidden insid thi stori ar the two greatest stock market 
secret you will ever learn.

first of all, greed is your number on enemi. you're not
go to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  don't wait for the boat to sink befor 
grab the lifejacket.

second, never trust an invest advis of ani kind.
thei ar look out for their own monei, not your.

the "profession", those stuffi invest counselor and
monei manag, will alwai tell you that the best time to
bui is now.  accord to those gui, the longer you keep
your monei in the market, the more monei you're go to make.
ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
"never".  

in a sens, thei ar right.  if you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probabl have over a million dollar
in thirti or forti year.  but here's the problem:

do you want to wait thirti or forti year to be rich?

hell no!

you want the monei now - so you can enjoi it. it's hard to
make us of your fortun when you're seventi year old 
in a wheelchair.  if you could make a million dollar in
the next few year, what would you do with it?  where would
you travel?  what kind of car would you bui?  

the fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

if your goal is to make quick profit in the market, volatil
is your alli, and stabil your enemi.  you want to see
those larg upsw, two hundr point in a dai, follow
by the four hundr point crash a week later.  you don't
care if the market went up or down 20% thi year as long
it wa unstabl.  that's how you're go to make the 
monei.

what i'm talk about here is dai trade.  

my father invest the tradit wai; he hold some good stock 
and he goe up 30k and down 30k. in the long term of 5-10 year 
he make monei. 

the dai trader bui or sell 5,000 share of xyz for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minut trade.  he act quickli, take 
advantag of all the inform at hi dispos about a 
certain stock, and estim whether it will go up or 
down within hour, sometim within minut.  

i can teach you how to do thi - and how to make amaz 
amount of monei at it.  it's not rocket scienc, and you 
onli need to learn a few basic principl to get start.
