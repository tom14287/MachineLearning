so did my build if the origin sourc is what you were mention ;-)
on drawback : thei chang from pspell to aspel appar, and it
requir aspel >= 0.50 which isn't even in rawhid, so spell check is
disabl for now until i take a decis about it :-/

if i build recent aspel packag, thei mai not be upgrad when ungrat
to the next red hat linux releas (the final version of the limbo and
(null) beta), which is mayb not realli desir. i'll probabl test and
see...

matthia

ps: the spec file wa massiv updat and the --with / --without option
that can be us to rebuild the sourc packag ar now list in the
descript ;-)
