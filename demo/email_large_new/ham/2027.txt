asid from the qualiti issu, two+ year ago there wa consider
internet chatter about bios on some foxconn model that were
unfriendli to linux.  accord to the foxconn articl in the wikipedia
foxconn wa forc by some of the compani which us foxconn board in
their own brand to fix those bios.  in ani event if the inform
in that articl is even half true, foxconn is a manufactur to avoid.

in view of your comment i look further into what is avail
local.  the model i wa origin look at wa a ga-g31m-es2l for
ca$59.00.  i found howev a ga-ep43-ud3l with the ich10 and mani other
more advanc featur includ better realtek audio for ca$83.00.  as
i am us an extern gpu which gpu intern chipset is provid is not
realli an issu for me. i think the latter model is better valu for the
price.
