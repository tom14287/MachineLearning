if you ar us setmovietim and  
qtvisualcontextsetimageavailablecallback  you can do everyth on the  
secondari thread, after attach the movi to thi thread.

if you ar plai the movi you need to plai it on the main thread.

normal you would us a displai link callback which call the  
qtvisualcontextisnewimageavail/qtvisualcontextcopyimagefortim  
combo. kind of smart poll.

if you don't want to poll you can us an imageavailablecallback and  
and an input queue but i don't see much benefit from that. the  
overhead of the displai link is small and if you suspect that your  
movi ha a higher frame rate than the displai refresh time you can  
alwai call qtvisualcontextisnewimageavail multipl time until it  
return fals. either you can keep up with the input or els you ar  
go to drop frame. the imageavailablecallback won't  help you there.
