re: the absurd of life.thei ar legal requir to do that.  i got a similar check becaus an
insur compani didn't pai a claim quickli enough.  it might have been
$.02.

although thei spent lot more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
altern seem to be to keep the monei.  do you realli want compani
to have a financi incent to over-bill you 'just a bit' so thei
could keep it?  for a compani with million of custom, $.33/custom
start ad up.
