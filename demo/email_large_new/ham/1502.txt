what is mime?

mime stand for "multipurpos internet mail extens".  it is the
standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binari data us the

imag, audio, wordprocess document, program, or even plain text
file when it is import that the mail system doe not modifi ani part
of the file.  mime also allow for label messag part so that a
recipi (or mail program) mai determin what to do with them. 

how can i read a mime messag?

sinc mime is onli a few year old, there ar still some mailer in us
which do not understand mime messag.  howev, there ar a grow
number of mail program that have mime support built-in.  (on popular
mime-capabl mailer for unix, vm and pc is pine, develop at the
univers of washington and avail via anonym ftp from the host
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.z)

in addit, sever proprietari email system provid mime translat
capabl in their internet gatewai product.  howev, even if you do
not have access to a mime-capabl mailer or suitabl gatewai, there is
still hope! 

there ar a number of stand-alon program that can interpret a mime
messag.  on of the more versatil is call "munpack".  it wa develop
at carnegi mellon univers and is avail via anonym ftp from the
host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directori pub/mpack/.  there ar version
avail for unix, pc, mac and amiga system.  for compab with
older form of transfer binari file, the munpack program can also
decod messag in split-uuencod format. 

doe mime replac uuencod?

ye.  uuencod ha been us for some time for encod binari file so
that thei can be sent via internet mail, but it ha sever technic
limit and interoper problem.  mime us a more robust
encod call "base64" which ha been carefulli design to surviv the
messag transform made by certain email gatewai.
