bob,

    live aboard a cessna 172 would be challeng, but i did meet a
coupl at an airshow in point mugu in 1995 or so that had convert an
old seaplan (it wa a bit larger than a pby, i think) to someth of a
float, fly rv.  thei visit a lot of airshow and cover a lot of
mile.  i'm sure mainten (on a 50+ year old airfram), fuel (for two
larg radial engin) insur and other cost were out of my price
rang, but what a hoot!

    on a more realist note, the flight to half moon bai wa probabl 2
hour of flight time at about  $75/hour in the cessna.  not exactli a
cheap date, but that's noth compar to the monei i've spent on her
sinc.  (and love everi minut of it, darl!!)
