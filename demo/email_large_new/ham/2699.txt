of cours. but the problem i had with gnome and xfce on thi system 
occur not onli in squeez, but also when run an ubuntu lt 
version and debian stabl. i onli saw those problem when us the 
restrict / glx driver. never with nv or vesa. i think thi is, 
perhap, more a measur of the card itself than the driver. but i know 
a number of peopl with "high end" graphic card from nvidia who have 
report the same sort of issu that i saw. it doesn't realli matter 
much as these particular system ar no longer us as graphic 
workstat. as thei've ag we stuck linux on them and us them as 
admin workhors, a job for which thei ar admir suit becaus of 
all of the screen real estat.

ye. in my earlier experi i would just wipe the drive and start 
over when i suspect that hangov from previou experi with 
driver were get in the wai of new configur. but after i 
becam comfort with a few differ method of instal and 
initi configur i start pai attent to thing like 
dpkg-reconfigur and debconf-show.
