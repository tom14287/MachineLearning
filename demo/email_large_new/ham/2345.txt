what should realli be the "big warn" is mix releas... i don't see
thi as possibl howev. how is dpkg to know that the libc6 upgrad is not
for secur patch or point releas?  i suppos someth could be put in
place so that the secur repo is treat differ.

the best wai to avoid thi: don't mix releas. when necessari, it
gener safer to build the sourc packag. you will also realiz how far
you ar dig into test when you start need to backport lib.

thi is potenti revers, but you should know in the futur that core
packag such as libc6, perl, python, and etc should never be mix between
releas.

i have no advic for fix the current issu... onli avoid it in the
futur.
