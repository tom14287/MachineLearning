your best option is, as other have said, to us pin.  if that
doesn't work, or you prefer not to us that method, you could

1) simpli uninstal durep us the packag manag you usual us,
then d/l the packag from the repo, and instal, by hand, from your
local copi.

or

2) build and instal from sourc as the packag manag will know
noth about it that wai.
