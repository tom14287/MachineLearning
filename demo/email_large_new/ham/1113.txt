re[2]: al'qaeda's fantasi ideolog:  polici review no. 114hello gari,


uh, plagu is not action.  no, no on ha a problem quarantin
someon who ha sai, ebola, or malaria, becaus diseas do not
requir ani decis action -- just contact.

fantasi, still requir decis action, even if it in conjunct
with the wai the fantasi work in the individu's brain. mani peopl
have veri strang and obscur fantasi (sai want to be a model)
that dont' requir them to be lock up.

fantasi aren't nearli as much like plagu.   not everyon in a
given popul necessarili adher to that given fantasi, wherea
everyon can get a given plagu.   (btw, gari, the whole concept of
monitor a given 'racial populaiton' for fear of them get a
plagu is silli.  i don't think plagu discrimin)

you're try to argu for a lock'em all up mental, when i don't
think anyon but you ha even mention it.   hi point wa that
fantaesi were a psycholog? explan for a possibl event.
not that all peopl who have them, or even have a certain type, need
to be lock up, quarantin, kill, rub-out or cleans.
