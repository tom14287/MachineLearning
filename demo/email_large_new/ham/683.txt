                               time for a snooz

         there come a time in everi august when new servic should
         just shut the hell up, becaus the weather's too hot or too
         underwat, and the world grow so dull and hazi that even
         the overexcit hardcor at linuxworld wander around like
         it's undead expo 2002, and the weiss-bake macintoxin can
         bare lift their wallet for maco x.2, and sun can't be
         bother to do anyth but run s/redhat/sun linux/g on a
         free distribut disk, and everyon els is on holidai, or
         get readi to be on holidai, or be told that perhap
         thei should take a holidai right now, and all we can do is
         look at thi aw, aw eucd legisl and stare out the
         window until dawn.

         yeah, it's our annual no new edit. we move to a faster
         server. do take the rest of the weekend off in celebr.

         or, altern, build up a head of overexcit for
         the public appear of thoma dolbi - the "hyperact"
         chart artist and beatnik audio plug-in advoc who, even as
         you read thi, appear to be host a 350 euro-per-head
         seminar on compos polyphon ring tone at helsinki's
         radisson royal hotel in finland. lucki deleg will learn
         about "us real-time midi control for tweak
         effect", "techniqu for make littl speaker sound huge"
         and - perhap most distressingli - "pick the right
         instrument and regist for best audibl". the
         cacophon cavalcad come to london's soho hous on tue
         and wed next week if you'd like to check it out for
         yourself - or perhap hold a street protest on behalf of
         music lover worldwid.
