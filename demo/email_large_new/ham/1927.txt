todai wa not as bad ... apt.cloudmark wa the server du jour and
experienc about 800 "unabl to connect .... reason: oper now in
progress" out of some 189,000 "bootup[1]"  or roughli 0.5% -- better than
the 1% befor but still a bit higher than i would like. i suspect it is
becaus a previou timeout from razor-agent ha a process id that is be
held by an open milter socket. the process id's cycl, the number come up
again and the error occur as a duplic pid occur. i will tweak my milter
set to shorten the total time to allow the socket to live per connect.

in look at core.pm i find a coupl possibl place where that code might
be. is it:
    my $select = new io::select ($sock);
    my @handl = $select->can_read (15);
    if ($handl[0]) {
        $self->log (8,"connect establish");
        my $greet = <$sock>;
        # $sock->autoflush; # thi is on by default as of io::socket 1.18
        $self->{sock} = $sock;
        $self->{connect_to} = $server;
        $self->{select} = $select;
        $self->log(4,"$server >> ". length($greet) ." server greet:
$greet");

        return 1 if $param{discoveri_server};
        unless ($self->pars_greet($greet) ) {
            $self->nextserv or return $self->errprefix("connect2");
            return $self->connect;
        }
        return 1;
    } els {
        $self->log (3, "time out (15 sec) while read from
$self->{s}->{ip}.");
??????
or
    unless ($sock) {
        $sock = io::socket::inet->new(
                            peeraddr => $server,
                            peerport => $port,
                            proto    => 'tcp',
                            timeout  => 20,
                     );
        unless ( $sock ) {
            $self->log (3,"unabl to connect to $server:$port; reason:
$!.");
            return if $param{discoveri_server};
            $self->nextserv or return $self->errprefix("connect1");
            return $self->connect;
        }
    }
??????
[of cours the latter reflect a differenct timeout set altogeth - on
part for proxi, the other for non-proxi]

it seem that we have all these catalogu server yet a good portion of the
time, onli on is avail or the last discoveri end up onli list on
(current honor.cloudmark) in the catalog.lst file.

i chang the default discoveri period to everi 12 hour in order to
compens for the recent sporad natur of the server' avail (i
realiz that the issu wa relat to sync and server upgrad .... but i
might as well plai it safe for a while).

mail-abus.org, for exampl, doe dn zone transfer of it rbl list -- i

i am drive at here). i realiz that there is an issu of pollut the

just the signatur that ar actual transfer across the pipe, is it
not?)

if i can be of help or if you have detail about to particip in thi
portion (cach or catalogu), pleas let me know.
