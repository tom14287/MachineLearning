thank again for your repli camal√≥n.

i boot up and got the login gui screen.  then us the choic of
consol login, and us my usual user name, log in with the cli.
then run "startx" ... and lo and behold get my kde4 main screen!

so i conclud that the problem li with the gui kde login.

although some might be interest in figur out exactli the problem, i
take on the role of a "user" here and wish to figur out how to make my
system well again.  (of cours, anyon read thi who want to delv
into why thi is happen, i'd assist.)

if you, or anyon els, could tell me what i can try to do to fix
thing, i'd appreci it.  i know i can do a clean instal of
everyth, but i would be hope that less drastic thing might work.
  ani chanc of fix thing by do a reinstal or particular
packag?  if so, not onli tell me which packag to try, but also a
littl guidanc with exactli *how* to do it would be appreci.

at least at thi point, i can get back to most of my old system program
and data, so the urgenc is abat.

i want to throw on other thing in here, just in case it ring a bell or
someon see some relationship to thi password/login problem.  i
mention in my origin post that i had other problem.  back in march,
just befor my emerg 1-week resid in a hospit, i suddenli
start have problem with certain program i regularli us (date wa
probabl around march 14).  the program i believ all us gtk.  some
ar: iceap, synapt, geani.  and here ar the result when i try
run them from the command line:

don@kali:~$ sudo synapt
synapt: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefin
symbol: g_malloc_n
don@kali:~$ iceap
/usr/lib/iceap/iceap-bin: symbol lookup error:
/usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefin symbol: g_malloc_n
don@kali:~$ geani
geani: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefin
symbol: g_malloc_n
don@kali:~$

unless there is some relat to my password/login problem of thi
thread, i'll start a new thread with the abov problem.

thank, and if anyon ha more idea on fix my password/login
problem, pleas help!

regard,
don
