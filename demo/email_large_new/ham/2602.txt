craig,

    i don't realli understand how you can make the claim that you
    make without a full understand of te, which you can't have
    becaus we haven't publish the detail.

    in the end, given that you don't know much about te or how it
    work, your statement realli call into question your intent
    given that you have a compet product in thi space.

regard,
