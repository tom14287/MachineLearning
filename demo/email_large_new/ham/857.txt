thank clive. your post ha been invalu in fix some faulti think
on my part, and in provok other us post. but i want more ...

the error that i am experienc ar all similar. the first
indic of a problem is a messag from the kernel (i think). an
exampl is:

kernel: [78454.939948] journal commit i/o error

thi appear on all xterm window on the affect machin. on the
xterm that is control a process that is us on of the usb
drive, there follow a long sequenc of error messag about the
drive be read-onli, which stop after a while. or sometim i stop
it by type ^c on that xterm. 

when thi happen, all the usb drive (3 of them) disappear from
/dev/disk/by-label (thei ar all label by me). i have not
discov ani to make them re-appear, short of reboot the
comput. after reboot, i run e2fsck on all of them, and alwai get a
longish delai on each while e2fsck commit (or whatev) the
journal. thi can take a few second or up to half a minut. then
i manual mount them us pmount, and all data upto the point
where the crash happen seem to be present. 

i have instal smartmontool, but i think there is some
incompat between the instal version and the instal
doc. the readm.debian make refer to edit some line in the
config file that ar not present in the default, packag instal,
config file. there is (appar) some incompat between us
the daemon and us smartctl. the problem host is run lenni, but
the doc seem to be the same as on a differ host that is run
squeez. 

i would veri much appreci some help in understand the doc.
what is a safe thing for a nubi to type as a first command to
smartctl?
