i don't think gpg sign my repositori will help anyth, as it will
just ensur that my passphras wa type to confirm the md5 signatur of
all pgklist and srclist. basic, you'll then just be sure that it's me
who gener the file, and thi will of cours prevent autom the
process of updat the apt repositori when red hat updat show up.

in red hat linux 8.0 though, the warn about "no kei" appear until you
import the right gpg public kei directli with rpm, for exampl :
rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/rpm-gpg-kei
(thi will import my kei, which is us to sign all freshrpm.net packag)

hopefulli it is possibl to the tell rpm to instal *onli* packag who
verifi against an import gpg kei? thi for me would be the optim wai to
ensur integr with the wai thing curent work.
