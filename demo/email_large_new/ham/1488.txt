oh, my ... wa i happi boi ... until now :)
no, i did not :(
so i download md5sum file from internet, it content is:
202b8e90d52b7eb3ed7294211f5aadf  debian-504-i386-dvd-1.iso
ad134f6556f8b79d39508a844ff59925  debian-504-i386-dvd-2.iso
45b9ad2bfaa20547f23471829e2f7d7e  debian-504-i386-dvd-3.iso
b46ee70c83e4e02107e4a5c271927459  debian-504-i386-dvd-4.iso
ca1ec6584d9e5df2df958ce5d647fb91  debian-504-i386-dvd-5.iso
4b07df455905e47f2db772b3715f46ca  debian-updat-5.0.4-i386-dvd-1.iso

after that i wa insert my dvd in oredr 1-5 without mount it
and issu command 'md5sum /dev/hdc' which produc thi output
(on line for each dvd in turn):

md5sum: /dev/hdc: input/output error
d6dd905d890c6f94e164f2b6c027c8a4  /dev/hdc
1b662e97035cce34e1e9fa42223cdfc5  /dev/hdc
6e0279dcd3dc5ff0dcf6e6188f6df2b3  /dev/hdc
15462fa19c0c49f517c66fb76e6ce109  /dev/hdc

therefor dvd 1 seem to be serious damag (thou i had not ani
problem with it when instal ani program - yet), and dvd 2-4 have
differ checksum, but i am not sure if thi is proper wai to check
dvd now when thei ar alreadi burn on disc.

then i insert dvd 3, mount it and run 'cd /cdrom; md5sum -c md5sum.txt'
it print on line per packag and conclud with:

md5sum: warn: 167 of 4996 comput checksum did not match

i did the same for dvd 2,4 and 5 but in now md5sum did not find ani
packag with bad checksum! all line ar like thi:

./pool/main/z/zvbi/zvbi_0.2.30-1_i386.deb: ok
./pool/main/z/zzuf/zzuf_0.12-1_i386.deb: ok

while with dvd 3 there were 167 line like thi:

./pool/main/a/asc/asc-data_2.1.0.0-1_all.deb: fail
./pool/main/b/balazar/balazar_0.3.4.ds1-3_all.deb: fail
./pool/main/h/hgsvn/hgsvn_0.1.6-2_all.deb: fail
./pool/main/s/simutran/simutran-data_100.0+ds1-4_all.deb: fail

i guess i am do someth wrong as on method show that dvd 2,4,5
ar bad while other test pass ok. at least i do know that
packag i wa try to instal from dvd 3 ar bad.

thank you.
martin
