you onli need to edit /etc/default/grub and run updat-grub in order
to modifi /boot/grub/grub.cfg (theoret; unfortun, you have
to edit /etc/grub.d/10_linux or /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober to chang the
default gener of the menu entri name or prevent os-prober from
pick up a window recoveri partit),

the squeez and sid kernel set the graphic mode through kernel-base
mode set (km). i onli us headless and xless box so i have not
look into whether the kernel us grub2's grub_gfxmode or
grub_gfxpayload_linux variabl to set the video mode. km can be
turn off in grub.cfg with either "nomodeset" (possibl superced)
or ".modeset=0" where video=i915|i945|nouveau|radeon... but i
have onli glean thi from read fedora and ubuntu stuff.
