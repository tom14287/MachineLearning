i don't want to reinstat thi discuss, but i just found sth which i haven't heard/read about 
befor, which might help you (haven't tri it myself).

i just start the akonadi trai util, then right-click on the trai icon and chose configur...
the second tab, label "akonadi server configur" ha a set for databas driver, which 
allow you to choos between mysql and ... postgresql
with postgresql select, you can specifi your databas set.

mayb that help.
