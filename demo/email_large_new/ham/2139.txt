_jeffrei zeldman_: parti like it's 1997[1]. “microsoft ha redesign. 
it new layout us font tag and other deprec junk straight out of the 
mid-1990s. ... when a w3c member compani that help creat xhtml and css 
ignor or misus those web standard on it corpor site, you have to 
wonder who didn't get the memo.” 

the new design also fail even the most basic access test[2]; the home 
page contain 80 instanc of imag without alt text. thi is the same basic 
fail for which the sydnei organ committe for the olymp game wa 
successfulli su in 2000[3]. 

here is what microsoft.com look like in a text-onli browser[4]. (to better 
understand the experi, take a piec of paper and cover your entir monitor 
except for the top line, then scroll the window slowli so you can onli read on 
line at a time.) while noth is technic lock out (all the link ar 
regular link, noth requir javascript to function properli), all the 
un-alt-enhanc imag (which ar mostli spacer imag and imag-as-bullet) 
add so much clutter to the page that it's veri difficult to navig. 

meanwhil, i don't want to imagin what it would sound like through a screen 
reader. want to find the search box? that's “1pttran dot gif 1pttran 
dot gif search for 1pttran dot gif 1pttran dot gif form edit box 1pttran dot 
gif submit button go 1pttran dot gif link advanc search 1pttran dot gif 
...” and i hope you weren't look for microsoft's access home 
page[5]; it's the 76th link on the page (out of 76).
