bob,

thi gui's an idiot.

i design load for system with the 50 kv capacitor.  on of those ha 864
of such capacitor and store onli 10 megajoul, which mean 11 kilojoul
each.  thei weigh 125 kg.

you need high energi per unit mass, and the capacit system i pick
maxim that.

it is precis the system that maxwel is tout for electr brake
and power augment for regen us in automobil.  you also need
voltag you can us in a dc motor, which is why though the actual
capacitor in the system ar charg to 2.5 volt, the system ha them
arrang in seri to boost the voltag.

ignor him.  he's a wast of my time.

sinc the energi you can pack into a capacitor is someth like
1/2*c*(v^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltag possibl
to fulli exploit that v^2 ;) so yea, a 42v system will onli be us for
acceler insect, not car. that must be why 40kv is standard not 42.
(the joke of put 42 into goggl to find that model wa not miss btw)

most product system us a mix of batteri and capacitor, as veri few
real world applic run for less then 10 second like the car we were
talk about origin. even 10 second is push the "capactior is the
wrong choic" limit. that why the landspe record model is a batteri on,
it's got to run for a much longer period of time and need a steadi
discharg curv.

but it should be safe to sai that most peopl want the indi 500 version, not
the 1/4 mile sprint version when thei ar look for a vehic :) for those
you dont want a batteri or a capacitor, you want to take advantag of whole
atom, not just electron. then you can suck off the electron you need with
a fuel cell. howev, you will us both capacitor for the brake/accel,
and batteri to not just dump excess energi in the design.
