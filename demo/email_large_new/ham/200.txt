so, do you have the two vga card enabl? i also have an intel embed 
card but iirc, i disabl it in the bio as soon as i plug the nvidia 
card (7600 gs).

otoh, it seem that devic id correspond to nvida 9400 gt. so i would 
test with the nvidia debian driver. if thei do not work, you can alwai 
come back and activ the intel on.
