hi pt,

in regard to debian, don't let thi be a discrimin.

if you had a 64-bit and 32-bit system, it would onli mean that you'd
have to burn two instal cd. onc those cd were instal, your
instal would be mostli indistinguish. after the initi
instal, debian grab the right bit for your system.

when i switch from 32-bit to 64-bit, the onli differ i saw
besid a differ instal imag wa a differ kernel.
