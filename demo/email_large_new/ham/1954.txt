sorri i past the wrong name: --revis actual took effect sinc the 
gener .deb is now (note the 'lore01')

linux-imag-2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompil_lore01_i386.deb

but what i need to do is to get rid of '+drm33.1' which seem to be 
automat ad...

the kernel sourc ar from the ubuntu lucid packag 'linux-sourc-2.6.32'.
