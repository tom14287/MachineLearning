somehow, it never got mention that lockergnom ha a gnometom for all 
you 
dreamweav user out there. denni jarrett, a gnomi from the uk 
with a prolif list of write accomplish, lent hi brain to a list 
of thing everyon should know to make us dreamweav 4 (and newer) 
easier to us. i 've never actual us version 4, have stuck with 3 
until recent start the review process of the studiomx  suit, but 
i've been  abl to appli everi tip i tri to some aspect of dreamweavermx,

phpmynewslett
http://gregori.kokanoski.free.fr/phpmynewslett/

as a free solut for manag newslett, for smaller list, 
thi doe most of what you need. subscrib ar store in a 
mysql databas, with the abil to send user confirm 
e-mail. initi, the address must still be ad manual to 
the databas, which isn't idea, but do thi gener a 
confirm e-mail with a link that user click on if thei want 
to be ad. the softwar purg address with no respons, 
follow an administr defin wait period. from the php 
interfac you can send either text or html format messag, 
with a built-in preview to make sure your format is ok. 
document is somewhat spars, so prior knowledg of php and 
mysql ar us in get thi instal.

opalisrobot allow you to schedul almost ani process on your server, 
ad an addit layer of function, like the abil to program 
telephoni command to complet administr task. opalisrobot 
effect process e-mail command, in addit to telephon dtmf tone, 
make everyth on your server administer from remot locat, 
even when you can't get remot control access of the machin. program 
job is point-click simpl, save you time even when you schedul task 
to save you time. if you oper in a window server environ, you're 
ad extra hour to your dai and cost your compani addit dollar 
by not have thi softwar.

not onli is thi inform great for improv blog access, it 
happen to be equal relev for *ani* site. the 30 dai ar near 
their end, which mean you won't have to wait to find out what's next; 
you can simpli click to the next page. mark pilgrim, the site's creator, 
set the stage with 5 charact (all of which could easili repres 
real peopl) and walk through their physic, mental, and technolog 
limit. follow the charact introduct, mark walk through 
an access scenario each dai and then relat the concept back 
specif benefit for each charact's limit. solut ar 
present with blog in mind, but with veri littl extrapol you'll 
be abl to make everi site you design more user friendli.

backend.userland.com
http://backend.userland.com/

i've been us radio from the moment i final got around to creat 
a blog. the softwar keep thing simpl and automat updat 
itself when new thing get ad. userland goe far beyond creat a 
desktop interfac for their blog system though. thei've fulli 
document all the xml, xml-rpc, and soap tie-in us to connect to 
their network, which could easili be adapt to other content 
manag applic with some xml knowhow. backend is the place to 
look "under the hood" at userland's xml inner work, includ 
detail document on make everyth work. if you've got 
modif or improv to the system, thei have an open 
discuss forum for trade idea.
