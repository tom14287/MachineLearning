ye and i understand that argument, howev.
sometim i find that if i don't try to write code in the least space
possibl or for exampl becom lazi and sai

--bad style
bool q;

if(q)
	when i should sai
if(q==true)
	
or

--bad optim

int a;
a=some_function();
if(a) <--which appar work but is 'bad code style'.

that's what i mean about let the program tool take care
of the code.... it's consid 'bad' appar.

or for exampl sai you ar write a loop that sai

for(a=0;a>
