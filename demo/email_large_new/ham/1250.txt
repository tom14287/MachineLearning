content manag is kei: need a reason your boss should be send you to gnomedex? some of the lead expert on content manag solut (those thing we affection call blog) will be share the futur of blog and how you can adapt it to both the wai you do busi and the wai you commun in gener. join evan william and doc searl as thei share pearl of wisdom on blog, linux and other open sourc applic that ar chang our live. if that's not enough incent, remind the boss that the internet secur guru, steve gibson, will be share hi wisdom as well. 
regist for gnomedex todai!   


to all you dream theater fan out there, pleas accept my humblest of apolog. 
i mistakenli announc their break up in the last gnomeaudio section, caus 
quit a stir among a number of subscrib. in fact, thei just releas a doubl 
album thi year and have been tour in support of that releas. 
for todai's fals alarm, pleas make note of the tragedi that is the n'sync 
breakup (oh wait, that's just wish think).

i know i've alreadi carri on about my kyocera 6035 phone, but thi thing is 
awesom.  i've got all my contact in on devic. web brows is good - i'm 
sure it would be better on a color screen, like the 
treo 270, but for what i'll need, 
thi work well. i'm current look for an ssh client i can instal, so that 
remot server login will be possibl. my on complaint is the base station's 
us of a serial connector instead of usb, but i suppos thei were cut cost. 

i'm also scope out the 
palm markup languag 
(pml) standard for mark up palm doc, 
in an effort to make the gnometom a littl flashier. i've instal sever of 
the file on my phone and while thei ar easi to read, have all the content 
organ, and function as us tip for the variou subject, i'd like to add 
some minor tweak to futur tome, so that thei look even better for me and 
anyon els who read them on their palm.

tomeraid v2.0 [1673k] w98/w2k/pocket pc/palm $25
http://www.tomeraid.com/


of the format lockergnom us for our gnometom, tomeraid is by far my 
favorit. design with a feel similar to chm, the tr format is quit easi 
to read, as it place section titl in a pane separ from content, 
allow you, the reader, to navig through our tip (or anyth els) 
with much greater eas than the linear format the other version present. 
the window version of the softwar is truli design with eas of us in 
mind. creat ebook for tomeraid is a simpl matter of combin a 
modifi set of html tag with the  design for page break. the 
onli trick for yanke like me is rememb that center is tag centr 
in the softwar.

triumph the dog is low-tech, he's not cute like the pet.com sock puppet, 
but he manag to maintain a twist appeal to fan of lowbrow comedi. in 
thi segment, triumph make a mockeri of geek stand in line for 
episod ii. whether you've been on of those geek yourself, or you've 
never understood why anyon would dress up and wait in line for a movi, 
you'll still find thi film amus. 10 minut wa more than necessari 
to get the point across, yet triumph deliv enough on-liner 
throughout to keep you watch all the wai to the end.

the man who wasn't there (r) 2001
drama - 116min
review's tilt (9)

special dvd featur worth a look-thornton and coen brother commentari

much more film noir, than a movi try to imit film noir, the man
who wasn't there captur the inevit hopeless of the genr. ed
crane (billi bob thornton) is the archetyp everyman. a barber by trade,
crane repres the individu in societi. he hear everyth, but
truli know noth. everyth he hear is modifi ever so slightli by
the retel. he get neither the whole stori nor the true motiv.
left to guess at the motiv and desir of those around him, crane
develop an indiffer to it all. when a snake oil sale man slither
into town, crane take thi opportun to cheat the cheater and punish
the punish.  as indiffer as crane appear, he is no match for the
amor of fate. as much as fate is indiffer in it wrath, howev,
so is it artist in it execut. that is what make our live so
entertain. fate dole ultim justic, but never as expect. the
man who wasn't there is truli a kafkaesqu tale of an individu's year
to turn against the tide of inevit. atyp of cuter, more
recent coen brother fare, thi film is reminisc of their earlier
noir work like blood simpl and miller's cross. franc mcdormand
doe an outstand job make as crane's selfish wife and jame
gandolfini exud boorish as dori' boss. the real outstand
perform, howev, rest with the support cast. toni shalhoub, as
pompu attornei freddi riedenschneid and  jon polito as the snake oil
salesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodi of their
charact. the black and white cinematographi by roger deakin also
impress and precis underscor the bleak of crane's life and
the monochromat natur of fate.
