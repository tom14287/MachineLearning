instal on hp t5700 from usb; partitioninghello everyon!

accord to thi tutori (http://d-i.pascal.at/) i wa abl to start 
the instal process from usb stick on my:

hp 5700 thin client termin
1 ghz processor
512 ram
256 intern flash drive

but i get stuck becaus there is not enough space even for minim 
instal (netinstal.iso).
now the question:

i have also anoth 4gb usb stick. can i instal the biggest part of 
the system on it?
if ye, which part of the filesystem do i need place on intern flash 
memori (id ata, faster), and
which on the usb stick?
