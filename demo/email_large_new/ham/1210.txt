[ilug] connect at 1200bp in rh7.3 (help!)hi all,

anyon ever try connect at 1200bp in linux? i've got a usr 56k
faxmodem which is meant to connect to anoth (same) modem and i have to
connect at thi speed due to the (nt) port set on the remot side,
but the modem handshak alwai fail at thi speed.

the modem handshak work at slightli higher speed (4800bp to
~57600bp) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remot server
as it insist at talk at the speed of treacl/1200bp.

note minicom fail to handshak at 1200bp, but hyperterm in window
work first time(!?), ani idea?

baud 1200 7 data bit even pariti

i am do a atz3 to reset the modem then i send thi init string:

at&f1e1v1q0x4y0s32;=232&a1;&b0;&c1;&d2;&h0;&i0;&k1;&m4;&n0;&p0;&r1;&s0;&u0;&y1;

... which is most of the default.

usr said to set s15=128 (disabl v.42)) 
& set s32=98 (disabl v.92 & x2)

but the s15=128 just make the handshak lockup instead of just give
up.

btw thi is a bank's system i am connect to so reconfigur their
modem mai be difficult.

colin.
