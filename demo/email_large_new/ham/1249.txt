agre, but where do i file a bug in debian to sai that instruct on 
how to report a bug upstream and how to mark the bug origin report 
in debian ha been forward upstream ar lack?

i've just attempt to do thi with icedov ( 
http://bug.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=579095 ) but how doe 
on do thi for the gener case?

i found the instruct on mark a debian bug as forward upstream 
not via the debian wiki or ani packag's instruct on report bug 
with packag upstream, but by a googl search which lead to:
http://www.debian.org/bug/server-control

mani packag do *not* list the upstream site for the packag or how to 
report bug upstream anywher within /usr/share/doc/ but 
ideal thei should be list:

- in the manual page for the program/configur file for that packag

- in /usr/share/doc/

and in the reportbug script for that packag.

i do appreci all the work of the debian develop/packag/releas 
peopl, but pleas help "fill in the gap" or "connect the dot" on how 
to go about report bug that mai affect both debian user and the 
upstream packag.

arthur.
