my laptop ha a via c3 processor. i us debian with a self-compil
2.4.19 kernel, and have had absolut no problem with the chip at all
(quit the opposit, in fact).

i had to compil for "686" in order for 3d acceler to work (the
kernel ha an option specif for the via c3), but i assum that wa
a kernel problem rather than a hardwar problem.
