1. feedback, note and comment
-------------------------------------------------------------------
cockl of on's heart  you mai recal that i wa a bit suspici
of the stori i told in last week's issu. jame woodfield point
out that there is anoth possibl explan. in mediev latin,
the ventricl of the heart were at time call "cochlea cordi",
where the second word is deriv from "cor", heart. those unvers
in latin could have misinterpret "cochlea" as "cockl". oddli,
"cochlea" in latin mean "snail" (from the shape of the ventricl
- it's also the name of the spiral caviti of the inner ear), so if
thi stori is right we should realli be speak of warm the
snail of on's heart.

serrancifi  mani of you suppli your own memori of thi odd
express that i tri to make sens of last week. taken togeth,
thei show that the express is best known in canada and that it
wa origin someth like "my suffici ha been suffonsifi
and anyth addit would be superflu". that form of the
word is the on that is most common in onlin search, where the
canadian focu is also obviou. cheryl caesar note that it appear
in a passag in margaret atwood's novel, "cat's ey": she ha two
teenag girl live in toronto in the 1940s who sai, "ar you
suffici sophonisifi?". a vancouv restaur review ha
the pen name "suffici suffonsifi". oddli, there's also a
1999 record by the austrian band cun dorx entitl "paradigm
suffonsifi". g h gordon paterson suggest that the word might be
a pun blend of "suffici" and "fancifi". there ar some
tantalis suggest that it mai actual be scot, and not new
world at all.

absquatul  i have been gentli remonstr with for describ
"sockdolog" as on of the product of earli american linguist
invent that hasn't surviv to the present dai. mani peopl
gave me exampl of current or recent us. i stand correct.


2. turn of phrase: thinspir
-------------------------------------------------------------------
thi is on of the kei word associ with a deepli disquiet
onlin trend. in the past coupl of year or so a number of web
site and chatroom have appear which activ promot anorexia
nervosa (known on the site as "ana") and other eat disord as
lifestyl choic. sinc 90% of anorex ar young women, these
"pro-ana" site ar usual run by and attract that group (on term
sometim us for them is "weborex"). site offer suggest
on how to becom and remain thin, often through tip on avoid
eat, and how to disguis the condit from famili and friend.
other theme sometim featur on such site ar self-mutil
("cut") and bulimia ("mia"). thin women, such as supermodel
and calista flockhart, ar present as "thinspir", exampl
to emul. site have had name such as starv for perfect,
wast awai on the web and dy to be thin. medic profession
in the us and uk ar deepli concern about them, becaus thei
accentu the low self-regard of young women, who ar particularli
prone to eat disord, put their live at risk, and discourag
them from face their ill and seek treatment for it.

the internet is home to a number of pro-eat disord web site -
- place where suffer can discuss tip, trade low-calori
recip and exchang poem and art that mai be us as "trigger"
or so-call "thinspir."
                                         ["calgari sun", feb. 2002]

a new trend among young adult ha been sweep the nation: pro-
anorexia web site. also known as pro-ana, these site glorifi
anorexia nervosa and offer "thinspir" on maintain a
starvat lifestyl.

3. weird word: usufructuari  /ju:zju'frvktju:@ri/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
a person who ha the us or enjoy of someth, especi
properti.

we ar short of word that contain four u's. among the few that ar
even rel common (leav asid the hawaiian "muu-muu") ar
"tumultu" and "unscrupul", although some rare word like
"pustulocrustac" and "pseudotubercul" ar also record.

the term come from roman law. "usufruct" is the right of temporari
possess or enjoy of someth that belong to somebodi els,
so far as that can be done without caus damag or chang it
substanc. for exampl, a slave in classic rome could not own
anyth. thing he acquir as the result of hi labour he mere
held "usu (et) fructu", under "us (and) enjoy" - it wa hi
master who actual own them.

the term remain in us in modern us legal practic and elsewher.
these dai a "usufructuari" can be a truste who enjoi the incom
from properti he hold in trust for somebodi els. mani nativ
american group hold land on a "usufruct" basi, with right to
enjoi the renew natur resourc of the land for hunt and
fish.


4. q&a;
-------------------------------------------------------------------
q. how doe the term "three sheet to the wind" denot drunken?
[benjamin weatherston]

a. it's a sailor's express.

we ignor landlubb might think that a sheet is a sail, but in
tradit sail-ship dai, a "sheet" wa actual a rope,
particularli on attach to the bottom corner of a sail (it come
from an old english term for the corner of a sail). the sheet were
vital, sinc thei trim the sail to the wind. if thei ran loos,
the sail would flutter about in the wind and the ship would wallow
off it cours out of control.

extend thi idea to sailor on shore leav, stagger back to the
ship after a good night on the town, well tank up. the irregular
and uncertain locomot of the jolli seafar must have remind
onlook of the wai a ship move in which the sheet were loos.
perhap on loos sheet might not have been enough to get the imag
across, so the sai becam "three sheet to the wind".

our first written exampl come from that record of low life,
pierc egan, in hi "real life in london" of 1821. but it must
sure be much older.

                        -----------

q. my east end mother-in-law us to sai she wa "well and truli
mogador" when she wa puzzl by someth. ani idea of
deriv and mean? [bryan]

a. now that's a bit of british slang i haven't heard in year,
though it is still around (nanni ogg us it in on of terri
pratchett's discworld fantasi stori, i am told). as you sai, it
mean that somebodi is puzzl, confus, or "all at sea". it's
also sometim spell "moggador", though it doesn't turn up in
print much in either spell. (no relat to the british word
"moggi" for a cat, by the wai, which seem to be a pet form of
"margaret".)

the writer of slang dictionari ar decidedli mogador about it
origin. it look veri much like rhyme slang for "floor", which
is likewis slang, mean dumbfound or confus. but the disput
aris over what the root is. some sai it is irish, from "magagh",
to mock, jeer or laugh at, via an unrecord intermedi form
"mogad√≥i".

other suggest that, like some other east end slang term, it
deriv from the gypsi languag romani (cocknei slang is like
london itself, a melt pot, in which word from mani sourc ar
amalgam, includ yiddish and old-time forc slang deriv
from languag around the world). in thi case the sourc mai be
"mokardi" or "mokodo", someth taint (these romani word also
provid the root for yet anoth slang phrase, "to put the mocker
on someth", to jinx it).

sorri not to be abl to be more definit!

                        -----------

q. i wa have an interest discuss with an american
professor of busi studi who also consult to industri. she
wa recal an unbudget initi within a major softwar
corpor, which the uk manag director describ as a "skunk
project". i have seen thi epithet befor, usual in the phrase
"skunk work", mean a semi-offici project team that is tacitli
licens to bend the rule and think outsid the box. i wonder what
the deriv is? i don't think it can refer to the smelli wild
anim, but neither i think can it refer to the street term for a
strong variant of marijuana. can you shed ani light? [martin
hayman]

a. we must start in dogpatch, the fiction place in the backwood
of upper new york state made famou between 1934 and 1977 as the
home of profession mattress tester li'l abner, in the comic strip
written and drawn by al capp. the origin wa actual "skonk
work", the place where lonesom polecat and hairless joe brew
their highli illicit bootleg kickapoo joi juic from ingredi
such as old shoe and dead skunk. ("skonk" is a dialect variant of
"skunk".)

we must now move to the veri real burbank, california. in 1943, a
small group of aeronaut engin work for the then lockhe
aircraft corpor (head by clarenc "kelli" johnson) were
given the rush job of creat an entir new plane from scratch,
the p-80 "shoot star" jet fighter. thi thei did in 143 dai, 37
dai ahead of schedul. their secret project wa hous in a
temporari structur roof over with an old circu tent, which had
been thrown up next to a smelli plastic factori. the stori goe
that on of the engin answer the phone on a hot summer dai
with the phrase "skonk work here" and the name stuck. it is also
said that al capp object to their us of hi term and it wa
chang to skunk work.

on divis of the compani, formal the lockhe martin advanc
develop program, is still known as the skunk work. the term
ha been trademark by lockhe martin, who have been aggress
in protect it.

as a gener term, it date from the 1960s. on definit is veri
much that of the origin and the on you describ: a small group
of expert who drop out of the mainstream of a compani's oper
in order to develop some experiment technolog or new applic
in secreci or at speed, unhamp by bureaucraci or the strict
applic of regul (kelli johnson formul 14 visionari
rule for run such an oper, which ar still regard as
valid even now). it is also sometim us for a similar group that
oper semi-illicitli, without top-level offici knowledg or
support, though usual with the tacit approv of immedi
manag.
