[ilug] train in ireland ?hi,

thi might appear as a veri strang email. mayb it is ;)

i'm french, and i'm current studi in a engin school in franc,
call utbm (http://www.utbm.fr). next year, from februari to juli, i have
to do a practic somewher in the world (in franc or elsewher).

i'm a linux user and develop sinc a coupl of year now (i coordin the
ko project, http://ko.enix.org). that's why i'm look for a practic in
which i can us linux and/or develop linux/bsd softwar. i also prefer
work in a small compani (< 100 peopl). but sinc i've never been to
ireland (that's why i want to discov thi countri), and sinc i have no
contact there, it is veri difficult to find compani.

so, i thought that the local linux commun mayb wa abl to help me by
give some list of compani that ar known to work with linux/bsd or ani
other free softwar.

thank you veri much for your help
