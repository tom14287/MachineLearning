as other have mention, rgw command-line paramet $1 probabl ha a
'/' in it.

a simpl workaround is to us a differ charact as the separ.
that is: *if* you can assum that variabl will not contain the
charact '|', you can us:

  sed -e "s|placehold1|$1|' -e "s|placehold2|$2|" < input > output

you can us some other charact there as well. see sed(1).
