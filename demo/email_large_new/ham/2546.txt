in all the discuss about rss 2.0, and i like him, and would like to work 
with him in the futur. i don't sai that lightli. thi even he post a note
[1] on hi weblog that he wa give up try to get rdf to make sens insid 
rss. as i read hi essai i could feel two-plu year of exhaust overwhelm 
me. i found myself write a comment after hi essai sai, among other thing 
"rss is not a brilliant format. it is a compromis. it is for syndic new 
feed. that's all it is for, for the 18,000th time." it's time for rdf to pack 
it bag and leav. rss deserv some digniti, as doe rdf. emphat, onc 
and for all, thei ar not the same thing. peac be with you rdf. leav rss
