that wa befor my time.  all unix system i've us didn't allow hard
link to directori, or if thei did thei were restrict to root.
the reason why is becaus you could caus infinit loop in the kernel -
usual a bad place for infinit loop.

to make them consist with hard link.

let's call these super-soft-link.  ln -ss

    % ln -ss foo bar
    % ls -i foo
    111 foo
    % mv floyd foo
    % ls -i foo
    222 foo

and now bar no longer point to foo.

    % ln -ss foo bar
    % ls -i foo
    111 foo
    % rm foo
    % touch floyd
    % ls -i floyd
    111 floyd

the fs would need to maintain a tabl of link go the other direct.
so when the move command unlink foo in the first exampl, it could
check the tabl and mark that bar is now disconnect.  the same would
be true for the second exampl - and even more import sinc bar point
to floyd if no tabl is consult.

and thi all fail to handl nf mount file system or filesystem
that have dynam inod (the fat fs's and reiser lack inod i think).
