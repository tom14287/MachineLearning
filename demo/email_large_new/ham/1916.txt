         summari is: if thei're not a teacher, a prison warder,
         disabl, or the cop, thei can forget their job. if you're
         anyon els - like a musician, or a cryptograph -  and the

         even if you *ar* a teacher or other except person,
         you'll have to ask the secretari of state if you can crack
         the protect cd. in write. each time.

         but there's plenti more to ooz out of the law than that.
         on of the big question about the eucd is "is it the
         european dmca, or what?". well, the dmca spurt bad juic
         in mani differ direct, but on wai in which the two
         ar similiar is over "circumvent devic". distribut
         decss, the dvd lobbi have claim, is a crime under the
         dmca. decss is code that wa also a magic danger
         artifact: a circumvent devic. circumvent devic ar
         about to becom illeg here. specif, three month in
         chokei (or two year if you realli nark the judg), for
         those who "distribut otherwis than in the cours of a
         busi to such an extent as to affect prejudici the
         copyright owner" on of them. "otherwis in the cours of
         busi" is legales for "as an ordinari punter", so it's
         not just mod-chip seller who ar liabl. anyon who
         distribut such satan machin is also a perp.

         that's not go to go down well with andrew simmon.
         regular ntk reader will rememb andrew as a lightn rod
         to lawyer. not onli wa he john doe #13 in the american
         decss case, but in a complet unrel affair, he waw
         threaten with all manner of nasti just for publish
         hi list of doom dotcom on hi websit [ntk 2000-09-22].
         in the last week, he's had anoth letter via demon, final
         order him to remov hi shini "circumvent devic" (aka
         decss) from hi site. it sound like the lawyer mai have
         shot their wad a tad earli: the eucd rule don't kick in
         until christma. but when the new law do hit, and if what
         andrew's preposter correspond sai is believ in a uk
         court, host decss *will* mean jail. there's been some
         talk about how the eucd rule ar better than the dmca,
         becaus thei specif exclud comput program from the
         new rule. well, it look like decss is no longer just a
         comput program. from now on, it could becom a special "nick me"
         tag for your websit.
