  | hmmm, i assum you're go to report thi to the nmh folk?

ye, i will, sometim, after i look at the nmh sourc and see what
thei have manag to break, and why.

but we realli want exmh to oper with all the version of nmh that
exist, don't we?   the patch to have exmh do the right thing, whether thi
bug exist, or not, is trivial, so i'd suggest includ it.

patch follow ...

i have no idea why the sequenc were be ad after the messag list
befor, not that it should make ani differ to nmh (or mh).   but sinc
i stop do that, the variabl "msg" isn't realli need ani more,
rather than assign $pick(msg) to msg, and then us $msg the code
could just us $pick(msg) where $msg is now us.   thi is just a
frill though, so i didn't chang that.
