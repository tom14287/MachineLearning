apt and a hybrid systemback when i had regular rh7.3 there wa noth better than "apt-get upgrad". but
now i'm run (null) beta and i have these question:

which version of "apt" can i us, the rh7.3 version or the "rawhid" version?

is there a wai to us apt to updat (null) with the rpm avail for (null)
through up2date, sinc i prefer apt to that?

if i can us apt, can i us it to get updat from these 3 differ place:
1. the (null) up2date redhat upgrad
2. the (null) file at freshrpm.net
3. the regular rh7.3 file from freshrpm.net

am i ask for too much simplic in thi complic world?
