the fact is that i didn't perform ani past: even run "gpg
--verifi" directli on the messag file fail (sylphe store e-mail
messag in mh format, henc each messag is on a separ file).

i receiv the messag encod as quot-printabl: mayb someth in
the middl perform some re-encod, that broke the signatur?

howev, that doe not explain why mutt is abl to correctli verifi
the signatur...
damn mutt, alwai on step beyond!  ;-)

wouldn't we be better off us pgp/mime sign messag (rfc 2015)
in order to avoid encod issu?
as far as i've heard, clear-sign e-mail messag ar deprec precis
becaus of thi kind of signatur breakag, due to possibl re-encod.

ani thought?
