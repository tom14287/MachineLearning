a problem with apt-gethi,

in my build script, i have problem with some of the kernel packag.

packag kernel-sourc is a virtual packag provid by:
  kernel-sourc#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3
  kernel-sourc#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3

on run apt-get instal kernel-sourc

second, is there some wai i can tell apt-get to instal either ? thi is 
done from automat build script so i'd like it to proce anywai.
