yeah, that would work, tho there ar race condit and like/possibl
ugli side effect (eg unintention left-over comp file).  i've end
up take a veri differ rout: tmda (http://www.tmda.net).  in
particular i us tmda outbound filter to add custom plu address to
the messag i send to specif list.

for exampl, for the tmda-user list i want a from: address of
claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relev outbound filter is:

 to tmda-user@libertin.org ext=tmda

which rewrit my from: header transpar.  when i get next month's
batch of password remind from mailman list i'll be run about
resubscrib to each list either with a standard plu address or a
tmda-base sender address (ie an address which onli the list in question
is abl to send mail to).

				  -+-

get tmda fulli happi with nmh wa a minor pain.  

reason:

  nmh, like mh, by default deliv outbound mail via smtp to port 25 on
  a defin host.  the port number cannot be configur (it call
  getservbynam() which doe a lookup against "smtp" in /etc/servic).
  ergo, you ar constrain to us tell nmh to us tmda-sendmail instead
  of smtp.

  us sendmail as the deliveri method under mh instead of smtp is not
  recommend as is lose a number of us bit of robust in mail
  deliveri failur mode.  further, when nmh is configur to us
  sendmail instead of smtp nmh's whom tool call sendmail as follow:

    .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv

  which creat problem:

    postfix doe not support "-bv" and return in error

    exim doe not support "-t" with "-bv" and return in error

    don't mention qmail.  i won't us it.

  "whom" is far too us as a compon tool in mh to lose.  

    it would be nice if someon gave the new crew work on nmh a shout
    about thi.  the "-bv" option to sendmail is pretti damn close to
    be allman sendmail specif and thu unfriendli to other mta.
    further there ar mani case where it would be us to configur a
    non-standard port to deliv outbound mail to via smtp.  nmh's
    current insist on onli us port 25 (or as specifi in
    /etc/servic) is a pain.

i've work out a hack to us tmda with exim while retain nmh's
"whom" support us exim's system filter:

  0) make sure that the follow option ar set in ~/.tmda/config:

    datadir
    allow_mode_640
    crypt_kei_file
    fingerprint

  1) chgrp everyth in and under ~/.tmda to group "mail".

  2) configur exim as per the current tmda how-to.

  3) set the follow option in exim.conf:

    messag_filter = "/etc/exim/filter"
    messag_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe

  4) /etc/exim/filter read:

    # exim filter
    testprint "local_part: ${local_part: $h_from:}"
    testprint "domain: ${domain: $h_from:}"
    if "$h_x-tmda-fingerprint:" is "" and 
       "${domain: $h_from:}" is "kanga.nu" and
       "${if exist {/home/${local_part:$h_from:}/.tmda} {true}{fals}}" is "true"
    then
      pipe "/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_from:}/.tmda/config"
      finish
    endif

  ye, that assum that all user directori ar under /home and that
  thei us ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  hack appropri for
  your setup.

basic explan:

  exim send all outbound mail thru the system filter (if on is
  configur) befor attempt deliveri.  the abov system filter
  extract the user from the from: address and pipe the messag thru
  that user's tmda setup via tmda-inject.

  the system filter run as the same user as exim, thu the requir
  for the chgrp mail.  if your exim instal run as a differ
  user, chgrp as appropri.

  it should be fairli easi to do someth similar under postfix, but i
  haven't investig that end.

note:

  thi requir that all outbound mail that is to be process with tmda
  ha a from: header which refer a local user (suffix ar fine),
  and that the from: address is fulli qualifi with a known domain.  if
  you're vhost the abov setup would be fairli trivial to extend for
  other domain and $home path.  i'm not vhost on my desktop and so
  don't care.  you could also qualifi on envelop or other header if
  you wish.

  a nice side effect of thi approach for those run share mail
  server is that all user who have tmda config instantli get tmda
  support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less
  complex and less prone to end-user error than the typic tmda
  configur.

caveat emptor.  

  obnot: i've also written a small patch against tmda 0.58 to add a
  "hold" deliveri method (ident to "confirm" except it send no
  confirm request -- veri us for test config or do
  silent sidetrack of mail).
