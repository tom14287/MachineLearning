so here's the final report on the hd/id parti. as no less than ten 
forker point out, the invit, while sent on sundai 6/30, wa onli 
deliv ten dai later on 7/9.

it got flag as spam.

ye, on a mail list awash in crap -- and some it is even unsolicit 
commerci email, heaven! -- our trusti mailman filter captur and 
quarantin just two post that week, on from me that wa > 100k (the 
fat articl) and on that wa bcc:d (the invit).

now, it wa a littl difficult to recalibr self-esteem, which as you 
can imagin wa proport to the two-digit attend  -- in binari!

accord to the georg washington documentari, i almost had as much 
alcohol on hand than he did -- virginia tradit be to copious 
lubric each voter. elect dai wa a public festiv dai, and it 
cost poor georg an averag of sixti-four shot of hard liquor per voter 
that dai...

so, herewith is the prize for most appropri flame my delai invit 
got:

perhap i should remind the latter gentli that it wa not in ani wai hi 
fault. the univers *wa* out to get him!

from my sin:

you call the great american shrine a... "boob tube"

ps. thi is the obscur footnot where i actual hide the bit in thi 
post. what we just encount here is that an event-process system 
with a 10-dai rtt cannot be us to reliabl handl event more often 
than onc everi 20 dai. that's why i wait to repli. six bonu point 
to anyon who can prove thi hunch of mine. hint: try analyz the 
problem in frequenc-domain.
