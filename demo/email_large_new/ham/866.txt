ok, i think i understand a littl bit better how thi is suppos to be
work now. try to add your touchpad option to the inputclass section
of the file /usr/lib/x11/xorg.conf.d/10-synapt.conf as a first test.

there seem to be a new mechan that allow for multipl such
inputclass section match the same devic, so that it configur
can be spread over sever file, with each file be abl to add
option and to overrid set made in previou file. if thi work
as advertis then it should be possibl to add your custom in a
separ inputclass section in, sai, 99-local.conf and thu make sure
that thei ar not overwritten when the synapt driver is upgrad.
that seem to have all the modular advantag of the earlier hal/udev
method with the ad bonu of the simpler xorg.conf syntax.

i am curiou to hear if thi actual work becaus i cannot try it
myself. (my up-to-date sid desktop doe not have a touchpad.)
