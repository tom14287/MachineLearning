look at man approx.conf for more detail on what i sai here.
each of you exampl line is interpret by approx as a name/valu
pair. thu each line start with debian bind a differ valu
to the name debian. onli on can appli. thei cannot all appli at onc.

if, instead, you chang them to

 	debian http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/
 	debia2 http://debian.cs.binghamton.edu/debian/
 	debia3 http://debian.lc.mit.edu/debian/

put into your sourc.list three line where you now have onli on
point to debian in you approx proxi server, the other two point to
debia2 and debia3, also in you proxi server. you probabl will get
someth close to what you want. apt-get or aptitud will work it
wai down sourc.list until it find a work server and updat the
correspond section of the proxi cach.

but thi would make approx creat three separ proxi cach, on for
each extern repositori. i think that thi is not realli what you want.

i suggest that you look at 
/var/cach/approx/
you will find on on subdirectori there for each definit
line in your /etc/approx.conf file. you might get what you
want by replac directori debia2 and debia3 by symlink
that point to debian.

post a repli sai whether thi work. i don't have a situat where
i can test thi exactli, and i'd like to know.
