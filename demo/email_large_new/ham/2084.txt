        the readm is out of date. i'll try and rememb to fix thi
 (feel free to file a bug report to remind me). 

        i am not sure why the revis flag wa not take effect (i
 have not had time to look into the mail yet), but the +drm3 is come
 from the kernel code (someth is set .localvers or the ilk).
