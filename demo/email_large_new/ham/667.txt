pluck and luckanyon who doesn't appreci both pluck and luck is onli look at
part of the equat.

america ha, in fact, move hard toward meritocraci.  but -- and thi is
a huge on -- you don't necessarili find it on the forb list.  there
is an element of luck, even if onli be in the right place at the
right time, to go that high.

beyond the forb list, there ar mani wai in which almost pure luck is
involv in signific wealth.  be a super-model, for exampl.
though i think most peopl would be surpris by a lot of super-model.
cindi crawford wa valedictorian of her high school.

most peopl, of cours, aren't in those stratifi realm.  it is the
rest of us who tend to sort.

there is a huge philosoph problem with the concept of merit in the
first place.  rawl claim merit doesn't exist.  sowel seem to agre
at least in part, but i'm sure sowel would also state that the benefit
of pretend it exist for societi at larg ar enorm.

and if merit doe exist then exactli what is it measur?  iq?  puriti
of heart?  or the abil to satisfi custom?  function most
peopl seem to equat merit with iq though thei sai it would be better
if it were puriti of heart.  yet the type of merit that land you on the
forb list, or even just be a garden varieti 'millionair next door'
is more like to be the 'serv custom' definit.

differ due to merit, when thei ar perceiv as such, gener far
more animos than differ due to luck.  luck can be forgiven.
superior perform, often not.
