have done exactli thi with debian, onli i us a pcmcia network card and
did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good).

howev, if you've anoth machin, look into thi null modem cabl jobbi:

http://rosebud.sp.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html

whether you can connect that to direct cabl connectioni've no idea.  you
could howev, put the file onto window, boot onto a ilug bbc[tm] and
mount the fat32 partit.

easier/quicker wai is to get your hand on a pcmcia nic.  also make the
maptop far more us in the long run.
