there is still anoth option: "d) other" :-)

mani cuban user ar not abl to brows the web (thei have internet but 
onli e-mail access, no web brows) so if that is the case, he cannot 
review the mail list post us web archiv and if he is not 
receiv e-mail come from extern user (non *.cu address), he is 
then stuck.

but i'm just guess, true is that in the spanish mail list there ar 
some post come from him, but *not* repli.
