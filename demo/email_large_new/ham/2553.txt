your right of cours - the attack wa perform for it effect on
muslim, not for it effect on the us. by show that it can be done,
thei inspir other to follow in their path, or so thei hope.

i take some object to the belabour of the term fantasi, becaus it
is somewhat perjor. imagin differ world can often lead the
world to becom more like that imagin. moreso if action is taken on
the basi of those imagin.

there an interest parralel with the great capitalist dream that
anyon can make anyth happen through hard work and a bit of luck.
thi is equal a fantasi, but on made to approach realiti through
consensu.

an interest question then becom, if al queda's action ar in
further of a fantasi, what fantasi ar georg bush's action in
furtherac of? how mani of the action of georg bush and the us ar
perform for their effect on the us popul? for exampl, how much
showmanship ha been put into rebuild the moral of wall street. is
thi not as much a spirtual invest as the sacrific al queda made?

what cultur myopia is in plai here in the us?

i make a point of read australian, britsish and us new. todai i
notic that the australian and british new ar featur the iraqi
overtur to the un on inspector, while us new is featur iraqi war
prepar (dig bunker etc).

at a time that the us is withdraw from intern cooper on
multipl level, the fantasi of be surround by enemi (invis
prefer) is somewhat appeal. a self fullfil prophesi, if you
like. perhap that's what at work here.
