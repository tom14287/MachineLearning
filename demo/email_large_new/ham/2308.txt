i figur i would pipe up here, becaus i have a kind of differ
perspect here. i have a 42u data center rack in my basement, and about
half a dozen realli old server. thei aren't realli worth much from a
financi standpoint, but at the same time, i us them as a sort of test
lab. and i have a tripp lite 1000va and an apc backup 1000 (just replac
the batteri) in the rack. i also have a backup 350 for my workstat.

it's not about the cost of the hardwar (as i said, almost everyth is 32
bit piii/p4 class hardwar that ha littl to no valu in most busi
environ (which is how i came by it, by and larg), but my data? that a
whole nother kettl of fish. it mai onli be import to me, but the point
is that it *is* import to me.
