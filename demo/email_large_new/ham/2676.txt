xine problemshi,

	i'm no longer abl to plai encrypt dvd's us the xine rpm from freshrpm. 
i think it wa about a week ago when i last rent some dvd's, work just 
fine, but appar sinc the latest xine updat on freshrpm, it won't 
anymor. 
the output is :

input_dvd: sorri, thi plugin doesn't plai encrypt dvd. the legal statu
           of css decrypt is unclear and we can't provid such code.
           pleas check http://dvd.sf.net for more inform.

i'm pretti sure it work with the previou freshrpm releas... ani wai of 
roll back updat ?
