daniel berling ha notic[1] that mac softwar shop ar start to move to 
os x-onli develop. thi make sens, for two reason. first, most peopl 
who pai for softwar have new comput. so while os x mai onli have a small 
fraction of the instal base, it ha the major of the popul of peopl 
who ar open their wallet. second, if os x isn't success, the mac is _
over_. it's not like system 9 is get ani more popular. 

then again, there ar veri few condit under which it is actual the right 
busi decis to develop softwar for the macintosh. develop for the mac 
is not a whole lot differ than creat a web site _that onli work on 
netscap_. (given the market share of mac[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
of netscap[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silli comparison.) 

robb beal wrote[4]: "try thi test. go to a ventur firm, angel, or big compani 
with a mac os x product/concept/prototyp. do thei consid the fact that it's 
a mac applic a net plu? (no.)" well _duh_. your product would have to 
appeal to _25 time more mac _user_ _[as a percentag] than window user just 
to break even. in other word, if your window product appeal to 1 in 100 
window user, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 mac user to make the same 
amount of monei. 

now, you mai want to make an _emot_ appeal to develop for the mac. 
that's fine. if you like mac and you're do it for fun, more power to ya. 

but as long as we're talk _invest_, you have to tell me why you're go 
to get 25 time as mani user. mayb there's less competit in your categori 
on the mac; mayb you're in a nich like graphic where it seem like mac 
domin (thei don't, it just seem that wai becaus the elit graphic peopl 
in big american citi us mac); mayb your product can't sell to mix 
environ unless it run everywher. but if you want to make an invest 
in mac softwar be prepar to demonstr how you're go to overcom that 
magic 25 multipli.
