consol font turn cyanhello folk,

i don't know when it happen but it must have been dure some
"aptitud upgrad" run late: my consol font turn from white to
cyan. at first i thought that the red vga signal had a bad contact,
but x came up in full color. consol app can control the color to a
certain extent, but the default color is a realli gross cyan which
produc weird color effect on an lcd with the thni terminu font.
in other word, i can't live with it. where is thi control, and
how can it be switch back to white again?

regard,
robert
