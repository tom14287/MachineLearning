hi andrew,

thank for jump in here.  i've tri the follow:

1. i have no ".xsession-error" (or ".xession-error") in my home 
directori or that of ani other user.

2. it appear the configur file for kde4 ar found under 
"/usr/share/kde4/config" and also "/etc/kde4/kdm/".  i tri move the 
"config" directori to an obscur locat and the do the "apt-get 
instal --reinstal kdm".  it regener the config directori but no 
chang in login.

3. i found that under /user/bin (when do the dpkg -l kdm) there is a 
file "genkdmconf" which look promis.  read the help file for it 
and execut "genkdmconf -no-old", the file under /etc/kde4/kdm were 
back up and new on regener.  now, i get a differ login screen 
background, but the action is still the same -- doe not accept my 
password.  i can still us the "consol login" option of that screen and 
get to the cli login and do so still allow me to startx and get 
thing go.

so it appear that your last paragraph appli.  i'll be glad to try 
(almost) anyth you or anyon els suggest on thi.

(i am also, per my previou messag, start anoth thread for the 
symbol not found problem i have in try to get some applic 
run (synapt, iceap, geani to name a few).)

regard,
don
