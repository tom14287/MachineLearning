strang behaviour: scanner and netbeanshi all

=46rom time to time i have to assess flash project, and to assist my =
mark a few year ago i wrote a program which us a scanner to open =
the .fla file and read it on a "line by line" basi.  although thi is =
realli stretch what a scanner should do, it ha proven surprisingli =
us over the year.

my origin version of the softwar wa written with an "old" xcode =
style project us the now deprec jam.  recent i decid i need =
to make some chang to it and i thought it would be a good move to =
transfer it to netbean --- and it didn't work!  the scanner wouldn't =
read a .fla file when run from netbean, but it would when run from =
xcode, us either a jam or ant type project.  it would also work if i =
navig to the netbean "dist" folder and doubl click the jar =
directli. =20

the follow code show the problem:

      string fullfilenam =3d "/user/boblang1/desktop/xxx.fla";
     =20
      try {
        scanner in =3d new scanner (new file (fullfilenam));
        while (in.hasnextlin ()) {
          string line =3d in.nextlin ();
          system.out.println (line);
        }
      }
      catch (except e) {
        system.out.println ("except read file: " + fullfilenam);
        system.out.println (e);
      }

when run insid xcode or by doubl click the jar, the scanner read =
the .fla file.  when run insid netbean, it appear to open the file =
but won't return ani line (the while loop termin earli).  there ar =
no except report. =20

btw, the problem onli seem to happen with .fla file.  i can read .txt =
file quit successfulli.

i'm run fulli up to date snow leopard, with the latest develop =
preview java. as far as i can tell, i don't have ani older version of =
java on my comput.  all the version in /system/librari appear to link =
to java 1.6.=20

ani idea?
