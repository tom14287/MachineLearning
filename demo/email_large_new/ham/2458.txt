[ilug] cdrecord + 2.4.19 = hard-lockhi all,
i've run into a fairli intract (for me) problem, and wa wonder
if anybodi could give me pointer on how to deal with it.

i am run debian woodi on a pentium iii id base system.
i have a ricoh 7083a id cd rewrit, which i us us cdrecord and the
scsi over id kernel modul.  i wa run kernel 2.4.18 until
probabl last weekend when i notic 2.4.19 wa out.  download patch
and instal new kernel with no real problem.  thi morn i went to
burn a cdrom, and the system lock hard.  reboot into 2.4.18 allow
cdburn to work fine.

thi problem is veri reproduc (on my system at least).
the cdrecord command i wa us wa
    cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso
the blank appear to go ok, but when it tri to write data, it just
lock up the entir system (can't ping it from outsid even).  afaic,
the system just stop.  hard reset is onli wai back in, and when it doe
reboot, i cannot see anyth us in ani logfil (/var/log/messag
/var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at ani rate).
cdrecord -scanbu work fine and report the two pseudo-scsi devic (my
cdr drive and my cdrw).
the same lock occur even if there is no blank.

i tri upgrad to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumpt that if there wa a
kernel issu it might have been fix in these patch), but it give
the same error.  i also download and compil the sourc for
cdrecord 1.1.10, and instal it instead of the debian packag (i wa
wonder if mayb there wa some compil option the packag had us
which mayb would caus the problem), and still the problem persist.

anywai, i'm complet stump.  googl search ha not done me much
good, and i'm a littl bit lost.  what i'd like to know is
a)  how to fix the problem ;-)
b)  is thi like to be an applic or kernel problem?  the sever
    of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but i'm
    not veri knowledg on these thing.
c)  should i post a descript of thi to the kernel mail list? if
    thi is an appropri cours of action, ar there ani tip (beyond
    the guidelin on kernel.org)?

like i said, i'm lost on thi on, so ani info is veri gratefulli
receiv.
mick
