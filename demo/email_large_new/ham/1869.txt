batteri monitor tool?
i'm look for a good batteri charg/discharg profil tool for my=20
ubuntu laptop. i'm awar that there's the "power histori" tool, but it=20
doesn't seem to do what i'm after. i'll explain....

a coupl of year ago, i came across a realli neat tool for window for=20
estim the time remain until the batteri is complet charg or =

discharg. it wa pretti clever about how it went about it. it would=20
constantli record thing like: how much charg the batteri said it still =

had, how much the batteri said it wa charg/discharg at, etc. the=20
tool would us thi info to estim the time to charg/discharg...=20
/but/ it also went on step further. it could account for error in the=20
batteri's report. for exampl, if the batteri report that it had=20
80% charg left, and then, a few minut later, report that it had=20
just 20% left, then thi tool would learn thi, and realiz that the=20
batteri wa old/problemat. so, the /next/ time the batteri wa=20
report 80% charg left, the tool would know not to give too=20
optimist of an estim for the remain time. in other word, the=20
tool wa learn what "80%" /realli/ meant to that batteri.

it also did someth els which wa realli cool. becaus the batteri=20
drain at differ rate depend upon what you're do with your=20
laptop (ie, plai a dvd on a bright screen versu just read some=20
text on a dimmer screen), thi tool would actual show you "best case"=20
and "worst case" predict of your remain batteri life (or time to=20
charg back up) base upon /actual/ discharg rate from /that level/ of =

batteri charg remain that it had experienc on /that/ laptop. so,=20
you'd open up the littl power-discharg graph tool and you'd see three=20
line: a best, a worst, and on in-between which wa what rate you're=20
current at.

so, two question:
1 - doe anyon know what tool that wa? (ye, i know thi is a linux=20
forum but, as long as i'm describ the tool, i figur i'd ask. it's=20
not the passmark on. i thought it wa call batmon or someth, but=20
now i can't find it anywher).
2 - doe anybodi know of a tool that doe thi in linux? or, is there=20
some wai to get the gnome power-histori tool to show thi kind of stuff?
