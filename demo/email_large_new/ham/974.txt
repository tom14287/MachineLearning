ok, noon ha been tool-less for memori manag for a long time. most
system you just add a flag and memori is track (that's how i've alwai
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through on of the 2.3e7 tool
where you simpli recompil and it it tell you where the leak ar.

memori manag is a non-issu for anyon that ha ani idea at all how the
hardwar function. grant, thi take 30 minut to go over, and so is far
beyond the scope of the "learn java in 90 minut without think" book
everi java programm learn from.
