i've done a dist-upgrad from 7.2 to a quit broken rawhid releas... it
wa a mess, still, it went much faster and smoother than if i had done it
"manual" with rpm -u or -f. i think that updat between stabl releas
should still be done with the instal sinc iirc, sometim a few
twitch ar done by anaconda to migrat configur to new format. it
should work though... i still prefer backup config file and
reinstal a clean system when i have the time.
