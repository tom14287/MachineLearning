right, there wa definit a rel high densiti in mexico, and
much less elsewher.  popul estim vari wildli and about all
your averag skeptic can do is take geometr mean to get ballpark
figur.  while central america mai have had 20 or 30 million, vast
area of south america were uninhabit and other place veri
spars e.g., the plain indian in what is now the u.s. mai have
been 2 million or so.

there ar those who claim that the mexican popul declin from
20 someth million to circa 8 or 10 million in the 16th centuri,
certainli, in part due to infecti diseas new and old, and other
factor, and wa probabl in declin befor contact.  other claim it
declin from 80-ish million to 3 or 4 million and somehow deduc 95%
mortal from import diseas, and have a pretti clear agenda which
make me (for on) take their claim with a larg grain of salt.

about all that is certain is that anyon aliv in 1500 wa dead in 1600,
in the america or elsewher.
