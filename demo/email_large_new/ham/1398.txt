 ye, i did "aptitud safe-upgrad" after "aptitud updat" and then
"aptitud full-upgrad".

i select "n" and it prompt me to "downgrad the packag to test".
thi mean that the version it had were newer than test, i.e., from sid.
how could thi be if i follow 2.7.3 of dr? accord to that, my candid
version is appropri set:

stuckei@debian:~$ cat /etc/apt/apt.conf
apt::default-releas "test";
