_jeffrei zeldman_: os x blue updat[1]. 

    a coupl of intellectu have point out parallel between the rigid 
    of os x, which deriv it power from unix and xml, and the rule of 
    standard-base web develop, which also compel you to do thing the 
    right wai instead of us five differ non-standard hack. the parallel 
    is not without merit. build web page the right wai is hard at first, 
    but onc you get it, you never want to go back. regardless, we miss os 9's 
    flexibl and eas of us, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that 
    feel of loss.
