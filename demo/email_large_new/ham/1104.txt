hi,

sorri for the ambigu.

by file/folder i meant the number of object insid a directori.

but mike show there is no such limit for file/folder and other
show me there is such a limit for folder.

folder=directori.

i work in a mix environ of bsd linux mac os x and a few ms
window server but the develop mostli us ms window as desktop
and ms languag is what i us commonli in offic so that is the reason
to us folder :-)

i rare us ext3. thi wa a server instal by some bodi els.

the folder limit wa reach some time back.

as a temporari solut some directori were remov .
thei will be fit new drive tomorrow so i guess i will format them
to xf and us that.

sinc ext4 also ha a limit an jf also ha a limit of 64000 i guess
i will us xf which allow 2^32 directori under a directori.

my inclin to us jf wa becaus that is the file system that ha
prove stabl for me dure numer crash due to power failur back
at home more than ani other :-)
