pleas forgiv me if my choic of word offend you.  that wasn't my
intent at all.  i wa speak figur, not liter.  my point wa
that swap out the product switch, which probabl ha other user
plug in, shouldn't be the first troubleshoot step, especi if it's
a manag switch and can thu show per port configur and traffic data.

thi data usual shine a bight light on these type of issu.  usual
the problem in case like the op is have relat to vlan configur.  on
manyi/most manag switch which have global vlan alreadi configur, but
not all port configur, if you plug a pc into an unconfigur port the pc
see a dead network.  the solut is to add that port to on or more
appropri vlan.
