i don't know if there's a sendmail-ish wai (it's not in the -d0.1 output),
but thi should work:

$ string `which sendmail` | grep -i milter

if you get a long list of function/messag look phrase, milter
is built-in.  if you get someth like:

warn: filter usag ('x') requir milter support (-dmilter)
milter warn: option: %s requir milter support (-dmilter)
@(#)$id: milter.c,v 1.1.1.2 2002/03/12 18:00:36 zarzycki exp $

then it's not built-in. :)
