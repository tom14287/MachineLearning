i too have an  abit nf7 (tho' not an -s).  the memori wa instal by the=
=20
shop where i bought the compon of my comput.  (i wa intend to bui=
ld=20
it myself and he didn't trust me with the cpu or memori!!)  he told me taht=
 i=20
had dual channel memori instal, and would need to replac both 256 mb=20
stick if i increas the memori capac.

i have never seen ani sign of dual channel oper. (tho' i didn't know w=
hat=20
to look for, which hardli help!)

dmidecod give:

memori devic
       [snip]
        size: 256 mb
        form factor: dimm
        set: none
        locat: a0
        bank locat: bank0/1
        [snip]

memori devic
        [snip]
        size: no modul instal
        form factor: dimm
        set: none
        locat: a1
        bank locat: bank2/3

        set: none
        locat: a2
        bank locat: bank4/5
       =20
would i be correct in take thi to mean  that the memori modul appear t=
o=20
be incorrectli instal, and that i could improv my memori perform by=
=20
move on of the modul that dual channel function?  and also, if that=20
doe not give me enough improv (which it almost certainli won't), i=20
could add anoth modul in the third channel, which would not necessarili=
=20
need to be the same size as the other two?
