can you clarifi?  list all the function in the current shell environ
solv my issu perfectli.. but less is just a pager, no?  oh, wait, did you
mean "much less list"?   in which case, we're in the same boat, but i'm

that would work pretti much everywher except bone-stock solari, where i
have no possibl of recoveri -- "/bin/bash: bad interpret: no such file
or directori".  at least if i us /bin/sh as my interpret, i can alwai at
the veri least output an error messag.

i suppos my other altern is roughli  [ -x /bin/bash ] && /bin/bash $0
$* && exit $?, and assum that everywher-but-solari ha /bin/bash. hmm.
if debian keep bash around as a default packag, even when dash-is-bin-sh,
then i guess i'm in fairli safe territori in that regard.

thank,
