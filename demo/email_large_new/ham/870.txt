get inetd to run leafnod via ipv4some time ago, my slrn stop be abl to talk to my local new
server, and i'm just now try to troubleshoot it.  i suspect thi ha
a realli obviou answer, but becaus i'm not at all familiar with ipv6,
i'm not see it.  i'm run sid, mostli up to date.

appar, the problem is that inetd ha leafnod listen on ipv6,
but not on ipv4.  i think i need to either get slrn to work with ipv6,
or get leafnod listen on ipv4.  actual i'd like to know how to do
both.  i'd veri much appreci ani pointer you can give me.

	$ netstat -l | grep nntp
	tcp6       0      0 [::]:nntp               [::]:* listen

	$ telnet :: 119
	try ::...
	connect to ::.
	escap charact is '^]'.
	200 leafnod nntp daemon, version 1.11.7 run at ip6-localhost (my fqdn: a.b.org)

	telnet localhost 119
	try 127.0.0.1...
	telnet: unabl to connect to remot host: connect refus

thi is surpris, becaus i thought you had to specif tell
inetd to us ipv6.  my inetd.conf ha thi line:

nntp stream tcp nowait new /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/leafnod

... but neither loosen my /etc/host.* file nor remov tcpd from
the loop seem to help.

i'm a total newb regard ipv6.  current my environ ha:
	nntpserver=localhost
... which some time ago allow slrn to read from the local new server.

chang to 
	nntpserver=::
doe not satisfi slrn:
	connect to host  ...
	fail to resolv

ani suggest?
