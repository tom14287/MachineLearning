hi,

when copi and past a .ps or a .pdf file, or a seri of such file,
the result (i.e. past) file' icon is often the `snippet' on,
i.e. the on which design a broken/corrupt file. howev, when
right-click on the file, their content appear as the icon, i.e. the
`snippet' icon disappear. why? is it normal? i do not like copi and
past file and see such an icon, becaus on might think that
these ar corrupt file.

thank.
