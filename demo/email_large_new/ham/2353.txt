if you ar ask what i think you ar ask, as in which file would you
need to restor your system in the event that you lose your apt and dpkg
databas, then i do the follow:

/var/backup
/var/cach/apt (less /var/cach/apt/archiv)
/var/lib/apt
/var/lib/dpkg

thi will give you enough that apt-get updat, etc work. now the rule have
probabl chang if you us aptitud as i believ it creat/us a
differ databas.
