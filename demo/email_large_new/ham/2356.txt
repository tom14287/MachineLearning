hi there,

i recent delv into how the linux system clock and the hardwar clock
interact with each other when i set up ntp on my system while connect
to the net. howev, i didn't realis that window alter the hw clock
as there wa no mention of it in ani of the doc i read. 
i still dual-boot on a regular basi and if window is sneakili mess
with the clock, i'd be interest to know in what wai it is and how it
couild be stop from do so. everyth seem to work fine sinc i
set the system up but i still don't like to have these gap in my
knowledg.

regard,
anthoni geoghegan
