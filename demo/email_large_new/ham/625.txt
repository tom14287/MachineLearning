to paraphras someth i heard onc:
unless you like look for a new job, never instal a non-releas or
develop-onli version of softwar anywher where the result of such
code ar import.

ie: don't run develop code on a product machin. :)


the problem isn't sa anywai, it look for razor1 and just keep on
go if it can't find it.  someth came up about amavi on the sa
list where it look for razor itself...
