by far the coolest solut to thi would be to "fix" php :)
take a look at main/php_variabl.c in the php sourc distribut.
you could mess around with the variabl is_arrai in
php_regist_variabl_ex() and see if you can forc all variabl to be
arrai :) as far as i can tell the reason thei do thi is to save
time by not have to work out which variabl have multipl valu.
