javawalk is a coffe-orient walk-tour of san francisco. 

    javawalk is a two-hour walk in the citi center. we start at union squar 
    and wind through chinatown, jackson squar and north beach, the citi's 
    italian district. while we cover the citi's coffe root (much more 
    signific than seattl's!) and coffeehous cultur (think beatnik), we 
    also spend some time on san francisco's histori, interest and arcan 
    trivia and stori the javagirl ha collect from mani year of live in 
    the citi. truli, some thing could onli happen in sf! javawalk also make a 
    coupl of stop at north beach cafe for a quick java jolt. sinc cool 
    weather prevail here, we need coffe year-round in the citi by the bai. 
    lucki us!
