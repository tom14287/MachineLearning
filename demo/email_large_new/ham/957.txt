/home/dudehi,

some time now the follow messag were haunt me:

     automount[11593]: attempt to mount entri /home/dude

it just came to my attent, that onli freshrpm benefit host show thi
up. i grep through the binari and found referr to /home/dude.

# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
binari file /usr/bin/aaxin match
binari file /usr/bin/gentoo match
binari file /usr/bin/gphoto2 match
binari file /usr/bin/gtkam match
...

i am now relax again ;), and pass thi info on. probabl matthia saou
himself is "dude", and some packag ha hardwir a path in hi build
directori. it would be nice to find out which and fix it, but i am us too
mani of the freshrpm suit to narrow it down.

regard, axel.
