............and that is what i did. kaffein is still give troubl 
with mpeg4-file &&. so i load again the intel-driver. thi driver or 
chip (x4500) is definit of better qualiti than the combin 
geforc 9400 & and the nv-driver. my conclus: no hardwar-problem, 
just a disastr by-effect of the latest nvidia-driver from their site 
on the hardwar-combin (?)of my machin.

so be it till anoth nvidia-driver will come up or anoth pci-express 
card.

thank you veri much, you all have illumin me!
