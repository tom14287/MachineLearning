rhapsodi rule



i never thought id sai it, but im chang my tune about subscript music servic.

when musicnet and pressplai launch their monthli subscript servic late last year, i wa unimpress. their music catalog were limit, the softwar wa clunki, and the copyright protect featur seem unduli restrict. i wonder how thei could ever compet with the seduct (read: free) charm of file share. but last week i decid to try out listen.coms rhapsodi, a subscript stream music servic that recent manag to secur record from all five major label. and now im rethink my stanc.

rhapsodi is not for everyon. if you like to burn your mp3s to cd or download them to a portabl player, youll want to look elsewher; rhapsodi allow cd burn onli for a small portion of it catalog, and onli for an extra charg, and you cant download mp3s at all. but what rhapsodi doe have is music, and lot of it--thousand of album of all major genr on demand as well as ton of preprogram radio station. i think listen.com might be onto someth with it stream servic. would you pai 10 buck a month for a servic that ha all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actual download mp3s? let me know at edit@download.com

here ar some repres respons from last week's question on who should take the blame for web site not be compat in everi browser:
"web builder should be do as much as possibl to support the broadest possibl usag by their target audienc"
a littl over half the respons put the onu of compat on builder.

"there ar far less browser maker than there ar web builder and user. so it doesn't make sens for user or web builder to do that job doe it?."
after web builder, browser manufactur got the most blame, although thi respons make the best argument.

"the ordinari user ar on group most at fault sinc thei tend to stick to onli on browser."
few respons said user should take respons, as most respond fall into the web user categori.

"as a profession design, i sai proprietari code is downright evil, no matter who it come from--and no matter what nifti trick it doe."
quit a number of web builder wrote in, with mani take respons while note the difficulti of test in everi browser.

"becaus web page ar view 90 percent of the time by ie it is understand that the time spent to make a site compat with the remain tini minor ha to be justifi."
a few respons quot server log, make the point that it's not cost effici to make site compat for peopl who choos a low-market share browser.
