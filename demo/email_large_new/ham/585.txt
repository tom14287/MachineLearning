is thi realist descript?  it is usual lazi mantain or dead
upstream which delai such fix.  upstream fix should like be around
if someon fix that for stabl.

i see... i now think place pointer to faq should be good idea to
explain all these issu.

i need to think think about the context of these.  thi wa in
section describ "archiv".  (i have other place where i sai "for your
**product server**, the `stabl` suit with the secur updat is
recommend.")  

so i am updat as:

tip: if "`sid`" is us in the abov exampl instead of
"`@-@codenam-stabl@-@`", the "`deb: http://secur.debian.org/ ...`"
line for secur updat in the "`/etc/apt/sourc.list`" is not
requir.   thi is becaus there is no secur updat archiv for
"`sid`" (`unstabl`).

note: the secur bug for the `stabl` archiv ar fix by the debian
secur team.  thi activ ha been quit rigor and reliabl.
those for the `test` archiv mai be fix by the debian test
secur team.  for sever reason, thi activ is not as rigor as
that for `stabl` and you mai need to wait for the migrat of fix
`unstabl` packag.  those for the `unstabl` archiv ar fix by the
individu maintain.  activ maintain `unstabl` packag ar
usual in a fairli good shape by leverag latest upstream secur
fix. see http://www.debian.org/secur/faq[debian secur faq]
for how debian handl secur bug.
