run xev from a termin window. if you move the mous cursor into the 
window that pop up, hold it still there and click the middl button, 
you should see someth like thi:

buttonpress event, serial 26, synthet no, window 0x400001,
     root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302587, (103,133), root:(107,155),
     state 0x0, button 2, same_screen ye

buttonreleas event, serial 26, synthet no, window 0x400001,
     root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302722, (103,133), root:(107,155),
     state 0x200, button 2, same_screen ye

if it sai button 2, your x11 setup is okai. if not, pleas run thi 
command and tell us the output:

   default read org.x.x11

if your xev run doe give you button 2 event, then there is probabl 
someth wrong with your window manag setup.
