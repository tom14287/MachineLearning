kaffein is a mere shadow of itselfhi,

i recent upgrad most of my kde program to the kde 4 version, and
for on program i regret it after onli a few minut.  here is a list
of the regress in kaffein i notic so far:

- cannot save track from an audio cd as .ogg file anymor

- doe not displai track when plai an audio cd, screen is black

- stop plai audio cd after first track

- window size is fix, video ar resiz to fit window size rather
  than the other wai around

- the set menu is almost empti, noth to configur anymor
  appar

- doe not have a manual

i'm not go to look ani further but will rather go back to 0.8.7 and
put it on hold.  it feel like us an applic that is mayb at
version 0.2, rather than a 1.0 releas candid.  given that kaffein
0.8 wa a quit matur program with lot of featur, i find thi veri
sad.

regard,
        sven
