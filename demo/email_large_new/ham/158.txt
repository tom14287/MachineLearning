nice trick.

on thing - to save an imag as an anim gif (for exampl),
you just do a save as, and set the extens to .gif - you should
get a dialog ask whether you want to merg visibl layer or
save as an anim. i believ that you can also specifi the
extens as .mpg or .mpeg if you've got the mpeg plug-in built.

cheer,
