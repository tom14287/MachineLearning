the whole virtuoso/strigi ensembl need a lot of polish. it is not readi 
for simpl usag yet.
i have spent some dai fiddl with that stuff base on my own experi and 
feedback i got from user at sidux.
the best wai i found to have a usabl index is:
 - stop nepomuk and strigi in systemset
 - move awai or delet everyth in: 
~/.kde/share/app/nepomuk/repositori/main/data/virtuosobackend
(there might be incompat databas from virtuoso 5.x in there)
 - out and back in to your account
 - start nepomuk andv strigi
 - let it do the index
 - test (in dolphin, krunner is unreli atm) your index
 - see if e.g. file under kmail got index

for me to have a complet index i had to do 5 run of strigi.
in the first 3 run it would not even touch ani dot file under .kde
in the end it work fine now but popular search us a lot of ram.
