1. turn of phrase: beanpol famili
-------------------------------------------------------------------
histor, famili have usual had more children than parent,
result in famili tree that look like pyramid. howev, in
recent year, especi in countri like britain and the us, the
number of children per gener ha steadili gone down, while
life span ha increas. thi ha led to a shape of famili tree
that some research have liken to a beanpol - tall and thin,
with few peopl in each gener. the term "beanpol famili" ha
been around in the academ literatur at least sinc 1987, but it
rare appear elsewher. a recent british report ha brought it to
wider public notic, at least in the uk. some research find it
too slangi and prefer the jargon term "verticalis" to describ
such famili. whatev term you prefer, specialist ar sure that
the demograph shift is have a big effect on person
relationship within the famili and (for exampl) the role of
grandpar.

the rise divorc rate partli explain the growth of the
'beanpol' famili. with almost on in two marriag end in
divorc, mani adult have at least two famili, each with a singl
child.
                                             ["observ", mai 2002]

note the rise number of so-call 'beanpol' famili in
britain (famili with onli on child), the report warn that a
child without sibl 'is starv of the companionship of famili
member of their own ag ... [lead to] greater social isol,
with teenag adopt a more selfish attitud to life'.

2. weird word: jobbernowl
-------------------------------------------------------------------
a stupid person, a blockhead.

unfortun, thi us and effect insult ha rather drop
out of us in these meali-mouth time. the last excurs for it
that i can find is in the classic w c field film "the bank dick"
of 1940, in which the word occur in a variant form in the line:
"sure, don't be a luddi-duddi, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a
jabbernow, you're not those, ar you?". befor that, it turn up in
on of the novel of hall cain in 1890, but even by then it seem
to have been rather rare.

it's from the old french "jobard", from "jobe", silli. that word
wa then ad to "noll", the top or crown of the head, the noddl.
the first sens wa of a block-like or stupid-look head, but wa
soon extend to refer to the qualiti of the mind within.
"jobbernowl" is the condit or state of be a "jobbernowl",
or an act or remark that is especi stupid.

care how you us it: the recipi might be a subscrib!


3. beyond word
-------------------------------------------------------------------
i've been awai at a heritag confer in colchest these past
few dai. on my wai back, my ey wa caught by thi warn sign
post abov some step at the local railwai station:

   caution
   do not run on the stair
   us the hand rail


4. q&a;
-------------------------------------------------------------------
q. for my job i have to read american magazin concern consum
electron, home system, burglar alarm, etc. i veri often come
across the express "bell and whistl", which seem to relat to
equip, accessori or featur that ar offer to the custom
as pluss but ar not realli indispens for the devic to work.
is that right? and where doe that funni phrase come from? [herv
castelain, franc]

q. you're right about the mean of thi phrase, which refer to
gimmick - non-essenti but often engag featur ad to a
piec of technic equip or a comput program to make it seem
more superfici attract without enhanc it main function.

the phrase is actual quit modern and mai be a product of the
american militari. at least, on of it earliest appear wa in
an articl in "atlant" in octob 1982, which said it wa
"pentagon slang for extravag frill". there's some evid that
the term ha actual been around sinc the 1960s, but the earli
evid is spars.

where it come from is still a matter of learn debat. a liter
sens of the phrase appear around the middl of the nineteenth
centuri, refer to streetcar, railwai and steamship. befor
modern electron, there were realli onli two wai to make a loud
warn nois - you either rang a bell or toot a whistl. steam
made the latter a real power in the land (anybodi who ha heard the
noisi out-of-tune calliop on the steamboat natchez at new orlean
will agre about it power, though less so about it glori). and at
on time "clang, clang, clang went the trollei" in larg number of
american citi.

at least some earli us railroad locomot had both bell and
whistl, as thi extract from an articl in "appleton's journal"
of 1876 show:

  you look up at an angl of sixti degre and see sweep
  along the edg of a precipic, two-third up the rocki
  height, a train of red-and-yellow railwai-car, drawn by
  two wood-burn engin, the sound of whose bell and
  whistl seem like the small divers of veri littl
  children, so diminish ar thei by the distanc.

could it be that to have both bell and whistl wa thought
excess, a case of belt and brace, an unnecessari featur, a
frill?

possibl. but it's more probabl the slang sens of the term come
from that close music rel of the calliop, the theatr
organ. extraordinari instrument such as the mighti wurlitz
augment their basic repertoir by all sort of sound effect to
help the organist accompani silent film, among them car horn,
siren, and bird whistl. these effect were call toi, and
organ often had "toi counter" with 20 or more noisemak on
them, includ variou bell and whistl. in the 1950s, decad
after the talki came in, but while theatr organ were still
common in big movi hous, these fun featur must have been
consid no longer essenti to the function of the organ but
mere fripperi, inessenti add-on.

it's possibl the slang sens grew out of that. it got taken up
especi by the comput industri, perhap becaus opportun
to add them ar so great.

                        -----------

q. the design of "robe" for academ dress clearli come from
it origin with the clergi in the middl ag. but what about
"mortarboard"? the best i could find wa it origin in the 12th or
13th centuri clergi cap, but that wa not squar-shape. doe
"mortarboard" refer to the guild or is it origin more ancient?

a. the academ cap often call a "mortarboard" is quit ancient,
but that word for it onli date from the middl of the nineteenth
centuri (a less slangi wai to identifi it is to call it a
"squar"). the liter mortar board is the wooden plate, usual
with a handl underneath, on which bricklay carri small amount
of mortar. a similar tool is us by plaster, but thei usual
call it a hawk.

what seem to have happen is that the similar in shape between
the bricki's board and the academ cap led some wag, probabl at
oxford univers, to appli the name of the on to the other. our
first record us is in a book of 1853-6, "the adventur of mr.
verdant green, an oxford freshman" by a clergyman name edward
bradlei, who wrote under the pen name of cuthbert bede (the name
of the two patron saint of durham, where he went to school).
verdant green is a sort of undergradu pickwick and the book
recount hi adventur. thi magisteri reprimand by a don
appear after on such escapad: "i will overlook your offenc in
assum that portion of the academ attir, to which you gave
the offens epithet of 'mortar-board'; more especi, as you
act at the suggest and bid of those who ought to have
known better".

after a slow start, the book becam a huge success, sell more
than 200,000 copi in the next 20 year. whether mr bradlei
invent the slang term we mai never know, but hi book certainli
popularis it.

                        -----------

q. i got into a discuss about "chip off the old block" with
friend, and we ar wonder if it had to do with sculpt,
jewelri make, woodwork, or none of the abov. what doe thi
term mean, and where did it come from? [vijai renganathan]

a. the associ ar with carpentri, and the block is definit
made of wood.

the first form of the express wa "chip of the same block",
mean that a person or thing wa made of the same stuff as
somebodi or someth els, so from the same sourc or parentag.
an earli exampl is in a sermon by dr robert sanderson (at on time
bishop of lincoln), date 1637: "am not i a child of the same adam
... a chip of the same block, with him?".

later that centuri, anoth form is record "a chip of the old
block", which meant that somebodi wa the spit imag of hi
father, or continu some famili characterist. at some point,
probabl late in the nineteenth centuri, thi wa modifi to "a
chip off the old block", which doe noth to chang the sens,
but is the wai it's now usual written or said.
