ye, anoth interest wai to us mplayer. you can us the
-dumpaudio option to get the raw audio data out of the file.  i am
usual not try to get the raw audio howev, becaus it might be
compress or encod in weird wai. i usal want to have a nice
uncompress wav file that i can work with. and mplayer is pretti
handi for that...

so mani choic!
