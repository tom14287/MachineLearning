						cnet review


 

dear reader,

it wa a crush blow to discov that vindigo, my
all-time-favorit palm app, wa no longer free. twenti-five buck
wasn't steep, but the principl of pai for a former freebi
wa hard to swallow. not that hard, though; surpris
myself--and my fellow cheapskat--i've discov that i'd
rather dish out the dough than go vindigo-free myself.

that's what web-base e-mail provid ar bank on. now that
most of us have gotten suck in by those grati web e-mail
account, most "free" web e-mailer have start charg for
premium servic or impos strict limit on free account.
read our review 
of the four top servic to see what you get if
you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you want
to stai spam-free.

surfac on thi week's buzz meter is anoth free-gone-fee app.
the latest version of the popular file-share softwar bearshar
now offer a paid version that let you search and download
without those annoi ad. mayb the best thing in life ar now
those with a fee.

bearshar 4.0:
thi new version of the well-known peer-to-peer
   softwar wa been complet redesign and come in two
   flavor: free with ad and paid without ad. thi is nice
   touch, but unfortun, 4.0 fail in on kei area:

   test, it had an abysm success rate at actual return
   file.

jaguar:
  who ever heard of an oper system releas be
