i fear newer driver. 

the first time i instal nvidia proprietari driver wa 3/4 year ago. 
in that time i wa run opensus 10.1 and hopefulli, nvidia provid 
rpm driver in their site so instal went straightforward (veri easi 
and work fine: i need 3d for run googl earth and twinview setup 
for the two displai i had attach).

that time (and that time wa 4 year ago) i instal the same driver i 
have nowadai (173.xx). why i have not updat to the latest on 
(195.x)? becaus "if it work, don't touch it" and i don't need to do 
fanci thing in that comput and the old version wa (and is still) 
work without glitch.
