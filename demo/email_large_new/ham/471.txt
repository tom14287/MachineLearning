re: applet on 32-bit 1.6.0_20there is a known race condit between nativ background repaint and =

java process when the browser think it's a good time to repaint.

should enabl or disabl the out-of-process vs. in-process applet =
set. if your macbook is actual 32-bit onli, you should never even =
see the 64-bit jvm.
