 ah, you see - cobalt's don't us lilo. thei have an openboot-like prom
that look in an ext2 partit in /dev/hda1 for a file call
/boot/vmlinux.gz - noth els.

 the onli wai i think you can set paramet is with a "set_param" line.

 howev, when i run 
    set_param root=/dev/hda2
 and then run:
    bfd /boot/vmlinux.gz

 it boot the old kernel, i assum from the prom. it seem to do thi, if
someth goe wrong - no error, just boot the default kernel.

 btw, 'bfd' mean 'boot from disk'.
