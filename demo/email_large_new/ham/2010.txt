re: [satalk] separ inbound and outbound
no i wa just a littl confus becaus i'm run procmail on a gatewai
and sit between the extern sendmail box and intern exchang bridgehead
server.  so there isn't ani deliveri to the local system.

the onli email it get is inbound at the moment and we're look to get rid
of complic and go back to two box.  i did a test which look like
you gui ar right about procmail, but test is veri limit due to the
config i current have.  it's just confus when set up as a gatewai.
