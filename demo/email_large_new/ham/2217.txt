dual channel memori questionhi,

the wiki on dual channel memori sai:

"the memori modul ar instal into match bank, which ar usual 
color code on the motherboard. these separ channel allow each 
memori modul access to the memori control, increas throughput 
bandwidth."

doe that mean that place 2 1gb modul, each into a differ color 
slot, is faster than put 1 2gb modul into on slot and leav the 
other 3 slot empti?
