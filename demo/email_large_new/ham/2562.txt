thi is my prefer mdadm 4 drive setup for a light offic server or home
media/vaniti server.  some minor setup detail ar omit from the diagram
to keep it simpl, such as the fact that /boot is a mirror 100mb partit
set and that there ar two non mirror 1gb swap partit.  / and /var ar
mirror partit in the remain first 30gb.  these size ar arbitrari,
and can be season to tast.  i find these size work fairli well for a non
gui debian server.

md raid, 4 x 500gb 7.2k rpm sataii drive:

	mirror			 mirror
	/    \			 /    \
 --------  3  --------    --------  3  --------
| /boot  | 0 | /boot  |  | swap1  | 0 | swap2  |
| /      | g | /      |  | /var   | g | /var   |
|--------|   |--------|  |--------|   |--------|
| /home  |   | /home  |  | /home  |   | /home  |
| /samba |   | /samba |  | /samba |   | /samba |
| other  |   | other  |  | other  |   | other  |
|        |   |        |  |        |   |        |
|        |   |        |  |        |   |        |
 --------     --------    --------     --------
	\	\		/	/
         -------------------------------
		     raid 10
		   940 gb net

for approxim the same $$ outlai on could simpli mirror two 1tb 7.2k
rpm drive and have the same usabl space and a littl less power draw.  the
4 drive raid 10 setup will yield better read and write perform due to
the stripe, especi under a multius workload, and especi for imap
serv of larg mailboxen.  for a small/medium offic server run sai
postfix/dovecot/samba/lighti+roundcub webmail, a small intranet etc, the 4
drive setup would yield significantli better perform than the higher
capac 2 drive setup.  us newegg's price, each solut will run a
littl below or abov $200.

thi 4 drive raid 10 make for a nice littl inexpens and speedi setup.
1tb of user space mai not seem like much given the capac of todai's
drive, but most small/medium offic won't come close to us that much
space for a number of year, assum you have sane email attach polici.
