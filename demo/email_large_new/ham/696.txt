some ar includ in the tarbal provid by the linux kernel team, which i=
s=20
distribut under the gplv2.  in particular, i am think of the iwl3945=20
firmwar that is requir to run my wireless card.

it doesn't matter what upstream want to call sourc code.  the gpl(v2)=20
defin it as the prefer form for make modif.  (gplv2, section=

3.)  it is unlik that the firmwar wa written in a hex editor (or=20
equival).  most like it is c sourc for a freestand (non-host)=20
environ with some manufactur-specif librari, but it could also be=
 in=20
some manufactur-specif assembl code.  either form would be better for=

make modif than a binari blob.
