barbara babbl;
be amaz - i've never bought anyth onlin sinc an almighti cock up
with amazon dot con (that's not a typo) a few year back where i lost
all the dosh i'd paid them and had no book to show for it either. had
it been the uk branch i'd have had them in the small claim court
quicker than you could drop lotr on your foot and sai "ouch", but as it
wa the us branch i'd just no comeback.
