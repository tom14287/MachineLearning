jakob nielsen on offshor usabl[1]: "to save cost, some compani ar 
outsourc web project to countri with cheap labor. unfortun, these 
countri lack strong usabl tradit and their develop have limit 
access -- if ani -- to good usabl data from the target user." 

offshor usabl is a specif case of the gener "offshor design" problem. 
put simpli, softwar team ar not success when 
design or manag ar done in a differ physic locat than 
program. onc i actual had a job where i wa in new york, my direct 
manag wa in singapor, _hi_ manag wa in hyderabad, and if i need 
ani manag input i had liter no choic but to go to the ceo becaus at 
least he wa awak dure the same hour as i wa. you can't get thing done 
like thi. a good project team reli on hundr of small interact a dai. 
here in the fog creek offic, we have 10 small convers about fogbugz 3.0 
develop everi dai. 

what i don't understand is peopl who think it's ok to move the develop ten 
time zone awai from their manag and expect good result. those same peopl 
would scream bloodi murder if you told them that you were go to 
send the whole _manag_ team to bangalor or beij.
