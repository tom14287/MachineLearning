hello,

i'm curiou as to the differ wai on can creat a usb instal stick, for
the purpos of instal debian.

it is possibl to do it by
a) acquir (where?) a boot.img.gz file, and then do "zcat boot.img.gz >
/dev/sdc". then load a netboot iso to the disc.
b) make a fat/fat32 partit on the stick, and then do "syslinux
/dev/sdxx", copi vmlinuz and initrd.gz to the stick
c) us unetbootin with an .iso file

i like the wai unetbootin allow on to us a larger .iso (dvd, or full cd
iso). the downsid of a) and b) is that you can onli us the smaller netboot
.iso, and if i want to load a few more file onto the disc for us i
wouldn't have the room to do so.

doe anyon know anoth method? i'm particularli interest in know the
wai to do what unetbootin doe manual, so that i could load a cd/dvd iso
onto the stick after make it boot-abl.

regard,
jame
