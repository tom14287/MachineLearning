good! your opinion of what is spam is unreli, and therefor, i don't
*want* to trust you. imho, that is exactli the case that the trust system is
suppos to sort out. peopl who incorrectli submit non-spam bulk mail to
razor.

then those lot of peopl ar unreli, and therefor will all have
minim trust, but the peopl with a decent reliabl and therefor trust
level will help us all...

imho, due to the number of messag you ar send, and the wai you ar
discuss te, (consid that you know *noth* about it), certainli
look like you ar simpli try to throw doubt/neg onto razor.

person, i haven't us razor for a few month now becaus i want to
integr it into qmail-scanner *without* spam assassin, but haven't had the
time to do that, so even i can't comment on razor at all.....

vipul & co, i think it would be great if there wa more transpar in the
whole server process, ie, if you know there is a problem, then tell all of
us, thi will avoid all the stupid "oh, it isn't work again, and it took
me 324 dai to work it out" etc...

just my $1 worth...

regard,
adam
