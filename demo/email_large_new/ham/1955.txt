hi, i have an asu "sabertooth" 55i (socket lga1156) with the same 
realtek lan chip (rev03 here), no problem.
the motherboard is overpr due to it's market hype regard 
"militari" grade compon and "ceramix" coat heatsink , but 
otherwis it's work great, and veri cool too with an intel core i7. 
layout is good for my need, ampl space for larg video card without 
block ani sata port. bundl is limit to bare minimum (esata/usb 
bracket and a few cabl). us for video process mainli, occasion 
kernel compil, virtualbox vm and the occasion game.work with 
squeez amd64 with stock kernel (minor sound glitch with on-board 
chip) and current 2.6.33.2 (100% function), suspend work too.
