hi goran,

i just post a followup with my complaint on the mc user list:
http://mail.gnome.org/archiv/mc/2010-april/msg00024.html

it's not that simpl as i mention there: when you chang that default 
option all the directori entri turn bright white and in mcedit the 
entri turn black on white with a blue background which look ridicul.

the problem is that thei chang a major function without fallback and 
without a spectrum of option.

too bad but it's wait until skin get develop or pin mc to 
prevent 4.7.0.1 from instal.
