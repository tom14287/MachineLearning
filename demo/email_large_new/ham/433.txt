sorri, i can not help you in thi. i just download the tora code and
compil it against my oracl sdk which is in the /opt/oracl dir. (i mean
i've put it there and setup all i need to us it thiswai)

so you ar ask me how i did manag to compil it in kde 3.5?

first you need the sdk. i've put it in each version dir respect. thi
is an extra packag.

also why would you convert someth from rpm to deb, when you can go to the
vendor and download for free the real code?

i've download and put all i need in /opt/oracl

ll /opt/oracl/

        --with-oci-version=11g

make
make instal

that's it.

i have to admit that for me the biggest challeng wa to download the
packag i need from the oracl site.

i rememb i've tri to debian onc but it fail and i gave up, becaus
i didn't have the time.
