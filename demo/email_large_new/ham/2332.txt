the peopl who pour the espresso aren't rich.  an interest issu
might be how it affect employ.

still, it is a 1% or less sale tax.  that might not make that big of a

the cost of track revenu and collect the tax might be oner.
wors than the cost of the tax itself.

me: i hate coffe anywai.  but if thei put a $.10/can tax on diet dr.
pepper i might have to start bui them in oregon.  (ye, i drink that
much diet dr. pepper).
