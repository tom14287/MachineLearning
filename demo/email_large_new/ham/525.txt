i do understand why a debian packag maintain doe not wish to becom
"upstream".  and i hope that someon who is both will and abl to do
so step up to the plate.  but withdraw it from the distribut seem
like overkil to me, especi sinc you want to withdraw it from squeez
and not squeez+1.  lilo, as it exist todai, work just fine for my
purpos.  and appar it work just fine for a lot of other peopl too.

the lord bless you, william.
