there is no guarante that (void*) is the same size as *ani* of the
standard integ type.

that, in no wai, mean that (long) cannot be larger than (void*). that
said, i do believ that the intent is that all of the standard integ
type can be assum to be zero when return from a messag sent to
nil, even if the word leav the potenti for a gap on unusu
architectur (such as where long is larger than void*).
