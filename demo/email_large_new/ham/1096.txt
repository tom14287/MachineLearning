of pdftk toolkit, itex and gnupdf librari, xournal or pdfedit, a set of 
applic and framework avail in thi "gnu/linux world", intend 
for pdf edit and manipul.

there is more than pdf/a (a pdf spec for archiv purpos) out there. 

have you ever heard about pdf form (edit requir), about ad 
bookmark insid a pdf file structur, about make annot or 
markup or just creat a link?

there ar mani situat where the user ha the pdf file but lack the 
origin document, and if you want to perform ani modif in that 
file, we (linux user) ar stuck :-/
