thousand spent on stripper, golf membership
show pentagon spend is out of control, libertarian sai

washington, dc -- quiz question: which of the follow item have been 
charg to the taxpay recent by militari personnel wield 
govern-issu credit card?

(a) $38,000 for lap danc at strip club near militari base.

(b) $3,400 for a sumo wrestl suit and $9,800 for halloween costum.

(c) $7,373 for close cost on a home and $16,000 for a corpor golf 
membership.

(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decor "river 
rock" at a militari base in the arabian desert.

(e) all of the abov.

"incred, the answer is 'all of the abov,' said steve dasbach, 
libertarian parti execut director. "thank to the feder 
govern's polici of dole out credit card with no question ask, 
the militari ha launch a raid on your wallet."

the shock revel ar contain in a gener account offic 
audit releas last week that uncov $101 million in "seemingli 
unneed expenditur" made by the air forc and armi in 2000 and 
2001. the purchas were made possibl by the feder govern's lax 
credit card polici: at least 1.4 million defens depart employe 
carri credit card, and last year thei us them to splurg on $6.1 
billion in good and servic, the audit found.

in on case, a group of 200 soldier us their militari id and 
govern-issu travel card to get cash at adult-entertain bar, 
then spent the monei there. the club charg a 10 percent fee to 
suppli the soldier with cash -- then bill the full amount to their 
travel card as a restaur charg, the gao found.

"ar these warrior realli fight terror while frolick in a 
strip club, or defend our countri while wear a sumo wrestl 
suit?" ask dasbach. "american who support a bigger defens budget, 
take note: the pentagon frequent behav like ani other bloat, 
reckless govern agenc. it promis your monei will be spent on the 
worthiest of caus, then squander it on thing you could never even 
imagin."

other spend uncov by the audit includ $45,000 for luxuri 
cruis, $1,800 for execut pillow, and $24,000 for a sofa and 
armchair at a militari instal in the middl east, dasbach note.
 
some militari employe actual defend the purchas, the audit 
note, by sai that recreat item such as golf membership can 
be "a us tool for build good relat with a host countri" 
such as saudi arabia or the unit arab emir. 

not surprisingli, dasbach said, the audit found "littl evid of 
document disciplinari action" against those who misus the card, 
so taxpay mai end up pai the tab.
  
"it's time to impos a littl militari disciplin on these deadbeat 
defens depart worker, and forc them to person reimburs 
taxpay for everi penni of improp spend," he said.
 
"then cut the pentagon's massiv $379 billion budget to help guard 
against such wast spend in the futur. perhap that's on wai to 
forc the pentagon to spend it resourc defend the countri, 
instead of offend the taxpay."
