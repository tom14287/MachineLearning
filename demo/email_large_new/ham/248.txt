i don't rememb a thread on debian-user about uuid chang with
chang hardwar (i could be wrong though!) but there wa a thread in
march on ubuntu-user where a gui wa duplic disk for a rollout
and he wa convinc that the bio of the box into which he wa
plug in the duplic hd wa chang the uuid of the disk'
partit becaus he wa unabl to boot from those disk unless he
chang the fstab to us /dev/sdax devic. i point out that the
idea that a bio could chang a filesystem's superblock didn't make
ani sens and that it could not be a uuid problem becaus he could
boot box with intel mobo but not box with anoth manufactur's
mobo (i assum that he could have repli that the other mobo were
chang the uuid and the intel on not...).
