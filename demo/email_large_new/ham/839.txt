i think there mai be some confus here, mr. krafft.  the comment
i made abov were not in refer to anyth _you_ wrote.  thei were
in refer to the origin edit of "the linux cookbook", by
michael stutz, which wa copyright in 2001.

   http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_toc.html

i suggest that you go back and look more close at my origin post.
