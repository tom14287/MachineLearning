thi step is unneccesari -- unless you've chang the script 
much, ani test in the log which aren't in the rule file will 
just be ignor i think.  you do seem to have chang the 
log-to-c script and remov the bit where you could specifi 
immut test at the top -- i took a brief glanc through the 
code and couldn't fulli make out how it had chang.  i think we 
want to be abl to specifi immut test score though in there 
somewher -- or is that now handl by the tflag stuff?  for 
the last coupl releas, ani test which occur infrequ 
(by thumb-in-the-wind subject criteria) i set to have 
immut score, as well as a hand of other rule.
