lxde session abort immedi.well, not realli, but that is what the messag sai.  actual, it sai that the session last less than ten second, but who's count.

thi start happen last mondai night after do a full-upgrad on my laptop, run squeez.

in realiti:  if i click on ok (the onli button avail) then the session doe inde end and i am drop back to a login window.  if i click the 'x' button, the same thing happen.  if i click the 'minim' button, howev, the messag just goe awai (it doe not appear in the task bar) and i can continu to work as if noth had happen.

i thought that mayb i just had someth mess up in some configur file in my home directori, so i tri creat a new user to see if it still happen there.  it did.  that elimin a person config file from be the problem, but leav me no closer to an answer.  is anyon els us lxde on squeez have thi problem?
