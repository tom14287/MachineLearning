inde so, in thi case. in the gener case, it might be quicker to 
enabl dhcp than to find out what network the router reset to. usual 
192.168.0. or 192.168.1., but not alwai.

in the dai befor internet dongl, the onli net connect avail 
wa usual the on on the other side of an appar non-function 
router, and the custom had no idea where the book/cd wa.

and to be honest, i normal run xp on my laptop, and it's just tick 
or untick a box. window ha move on, no reboot necessari... i can 
rememb need the instal cd to chang ip address on 95/98.
