[satalk] person/site-wide sa glitch (spamassassin+exim)hello peopl,

i am new to sa but (2) problem i do have.

i run sa from my own home for person us and it seem to work but i see thi
in my procmail log:



procmail: execut " ~/bin/spamassassin/spamassassin -p -c ~/bin/spamassassin/rule"
dccproc: not found
dccproc: not found


can someon enlighten me on why i get that? freebsd 4.6-stabl, sa-2.3.0



secondli, i've test (now on three box) sa for site-wide usag but i believ i am
miss someth major becaus i've also had my set check/verifi.

the problem is that the site-wide setup doe not seem to work. why?

1. i have my local.cf in /etc/mail/spamassassin
2. i have spamd run, and mail deliveri log show that all e-mail ar
   be pass thro sa.

my local.cf contain:

enabl=1
option="-f 0"

#
rewrit_subject         0
report_header           1  
defang_mime             0
requir_hit           7.0
report_header           1
us_ters_report        1
subject_tag             **spam**



wash ('tty') ~ 337 -> exim -bt engingwarez@runjiri.co.ke
eng.ngware@runji.co.ke
  deliv to enginngwar in domain runjiri.co.ke
  director = spamcheck_director, transport = spamcheck


howev when i check the mail deliv to thi mailbox, sa ha _not_ ad ani header
to it.

pertin: i also run a viru scanner call drweb via exim's system filter and the rule
that i have appli ar:

if not first_deliveri or
    $receiv_protocol is "drweb-scan" or
    $receiv_protocol is "spam-scan"
then
  finish
endif


some enlighten would bail me out, i believ.

thank



-wash
