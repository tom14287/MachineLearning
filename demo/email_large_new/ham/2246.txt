yeah but i wa right and i wa there. the peopl who were sai that it
did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. it onli came back
after the server wa reboot properli. howev improb it seem at
the time, the nameserv came back up after a power outag without the
.ie zonefil. as a result it, there wa noth in the file that the
secondari pick up. at the time, i thought that the file wa on an
nf. but if it regener after reboot, and the nf input wa not
there, it would have gener a blank zonefil - that make some sens.
histori now but it ha an alarm relev. :)

confirm that. the nameserv themselv had connect problem from
what i could see and it wa go on for a while, even *after* the
initi soa problem. 

i am think of write a simpl .ie secondari state monitor for
inclus on whoisireland.com as these gui seem to be technolog
incap of run their own dnse. what kind of distort logic hand
the admin of a nation tld to a compani that doe not even handl dn
for it own domain? whatev select process iedr us should be
investig by the relev govern depart, especi as the
compani supposedli provid technic administr to iedr did not
actual spot thi loss of synch. the iedr contract with the compani
should be review in the light of thi event. thi kind of 1 week loss
of synch should not happen with a nation domain. ireland as e-hub -
more like e-jit central! :)
