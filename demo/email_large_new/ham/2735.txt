what seem to work for me (and i agre, it's pretti confus,
especi when you add 'man grub-set-default' to the mix) is to
includ these three line in menu.lst:

default	save
# updatedefaultentri=true
# savedefault=true

i'm not quit certain which ar necessari, but as i've said, thi seem
to give me the behavior that i (and, iiuc, you) want.
