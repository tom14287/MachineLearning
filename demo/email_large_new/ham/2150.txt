ye, i'm sai that if he extend "genet engin" to includ
select anim to breed, he must extend it to includ select
peopl to breed with.

i'm sai that my parent select each other, and that thei did so
becaus (among other reason) each want the other's gene to be
mix with their own in the offspr that thei were plan.

what doe it matter that thei were select to produc their own
offspr, rather than the offspr of two unrel anim?
