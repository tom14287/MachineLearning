i think i'm go to becom on of _those_ peopl. you know, on of those 
peopl who ha a “semant web” categori on their weblog. thi will 
be a geek puriti test question somedai. onward: 

- _phil ringnalda_: fun with rdf[1]. “rdf can actual be fun, as long as 
you don't foolishli invest too much ego in try to store rss 1.0, or wander 
off into flame war.” from which we find: 
- _shellei power_: the rdf queri-o-matic[2], and the rdf queri-o-matic 
explain[3]. “the queri-o-matic accept the name of an rdf file (ani 
valid rdf file), and an rdfql (rdf queri languag) queri, and will print out a 
test valu found as a result of that queri.” 
- _marcu campbel_: “my foaf autocr script is move along nice
[4]. it's now loop through my opml blogrol file, check the first load of 
bite in peopl's page for head link foaf file, grab certain element 
from these file (if thei have on) and spit them out into a brand new foaf 
file for me.” 
- _joe gregorio_: the well-form web[5]. “after spend some time 
badger poor bill kearnei for a concret benefit of have rdf in rss 1.0 and 
not get a realli satisfactori answer i went back and read paul ford's essai 
again. i want to get that old religi feel back again. it didn't work. 
the magic wa gone.”
