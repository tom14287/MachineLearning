ye, it's definit extra work.  the question is how much extra 
work, both up front, and then on an ongo basi.  i know 
noth about how the trust system is work (still wait for 
that long-promis server code to be publish), but now that 
it's been turn on, and the more info that's come out about 
it, the more concern i'm becom that it's extrem easi to 
game; that the initi amount of work to set up a game agent 
is low, and that onc it's set up, it can be "fire and forget" 
in term of continu to oper in a wai that's not easi to 
distinguish from real user behavior.

anoth concern i have with the wai the system might be work 
is that it might not actual requir veri mani gamer at all to 
utterli undermin the whole system.  there ar a certain number 
of possibl univers where the trust system is veri sensit 
to liar, or misclassifi of "grai" mail, or both.  it's not 
clear yet whether thi univers is on of those or not.

you do need a certain level of accuraci though, or the filter is 
not econom worthwhil.  if you onli filter 75% of spam, 
you're wast your time.  some peopl receiv on the order of a 
10:1 ratio of spam:real mail -- 75% mean the ratio adjust to 
5:2 which is still shitti.  95% make it 1:2, which is better.  
99% make it 1:10 which is quit nice.  as the global ratio of 
spam:mail rise, thi problem get somewhat more import.  
with an order of magnitud worsen of the incom spam:real 
ratio, 100:1, 99% effect still work ok.  75% effect is 
now realli, realli shitti.

time will tell.  time will also tell how good the system is at

sa definit ha a non-zero fp rate, and alwai will have.  i 
would argu that ani system will have a non-zero fp rate, 
includ the "no filter" filter -- human make mistak too 
sometim!  as spammer strategi evolv over time though, i'm 
fairli sure that sa will be abl to adjust and compens.  if 
spammer figur out how to easili pollut the spamnet trust 
system, i'm not sure how easi it'll be to replac the trust 
system with someth els.

lot of theoriz, most of it base on littl data.  the kei 
premis i'm worri about though ar:

1. trust system is easi to pollut
2. trust system is not person, which make the assumpt that 
all honest voter agre on what constitut spam

razor2 seem to have been a long time in come, appar is 
quit resourc intens (judg by cloudmark's fundrais 
effort), and doesn't current work.  it ha great promis, and 
i'm hope that onc the wrinkl ar work through, it'll add 
anoth power tool in the war on spam -- i'm just concern 
that it's get off on the wrong foot and might not be abl to 
recov.
