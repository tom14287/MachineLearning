my girlfriend's dell mini's screen got crack on a recent trip even though
we had it in a protect case and now the netbook is useless, becaus to
replac on of those screen basic requir take the entir machin
apart and it's out of warranti.  my 6 year old dell latitud d800 on the
other hand, while weigh in about 3 time as much, is solid as a brick and
the screen ha no flex.  after the dell mini last onli 8 month, we've
decid no more netbook.  but that's just our experi, i know netbook
work well for some peopl.   i question their durabl for us while
travel though, which is kinda the whole point of the netbook...
