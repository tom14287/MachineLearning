there wa a fascin articl in the economist 1-2 week back (the issu
with a pregnant-look statu of liberti on the front) that state that
even for the nativ us popul, fertil had jump in the last decad
and a half. i think the current figur for the us is a littl over 2, but
not quit the ~2.1 of replac rate. combin with the veri fertil
non-nativ popul, the articl impli the us wa go to have a
signific increas in popul over earlier predict. as well, the
popul would overal be more youth, with associ implic for
be abl to fund social program, militari spend, consum spend,
etc.

europ did not show the same increas in fertil.

some actual data for the us ar here:
