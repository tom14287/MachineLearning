recompil the kernel with a differ version namehi

i've just recompil the kernel from sourc with the command

fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-recompil kernel-imag 
kernel-header

and instal it successfulli.

howev, the kernel name is

2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompil

and that "+drm33.1" seem to caus problem to eclips which doe not 
recogn it as a valid version (i think the problem is with the '+' 
charact).

is there a wai to chang the version so that i can do without that '+'?

thank in advanc
