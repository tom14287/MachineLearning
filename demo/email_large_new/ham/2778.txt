i'm not sure what you mean. what is an "extra" iso?

you mean the full set of cd or dvd imag? i find a net instal work best 
nowadai. then you just download and instal packag as you want to.

the archiv is simpli huge now so it's a lot to download and burn unless you 
have machin that ar not connect to the net that you want to instal or 
updat.
