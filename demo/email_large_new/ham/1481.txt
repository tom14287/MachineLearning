trii with dragonplay it also fail with xine backend, amarok and
kaffein on the other hand plai it complet.

switch to gstreamer backend and dragonplay plai it successfulli.

i think you mai have to file two separ bugreport: on to k3b
suggest as a new featur to us ogg file instead of wav; and a
separ to phonon indic to xine backend fail to plai k3b's
file.

but sinc it doe plai ok with amarok (which also us phonon)
probabl will be nice to ask thi question to a phonon develop,
mayb that the issu is in k3b and dragonplay.

cheer,
