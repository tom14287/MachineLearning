aptitud updat think there ar no updat! (solv by delet 
	apt/list)hi all,

after about a fortnight, i tri to updat my debian squeez desktop,
and i wa us the mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in mirror. after download
the repositori list, it tell me there ar no updat -- i am
surpris as i know that gnome 2.30 is alreadi in test. think
that it could be a problem with the mirror, i switch to
ftp.ch.debian.org and updat. thi time, it doe sai there ar about
300 updat.

i issu a safe-upgrad, but the electr goe out just as the
updat begin download. after i turn the comput back on, issu
a safe-upgrad show there ar no updat! i try to aptitud updat
but it think that the repositori ar alreadi updat, though
apt-cach show nautilu give the version 2.28.4. as i wa in a hurri
at the time, i just delet /var/lib/apt/list, so aptitud had no
choic but to realli download the list. after thi the safe-upgrad
proceed as usual. i realis after delet /var/lib/apt/list that
i should have kept a copi, but too late.

though the problem is (in a sens) solv, i am curiou as to how thi
(bug?) could have occur. after all thi i check
mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in  and it doe have nautilu 2.30.1, so mayb the
first no-updat scenario wa also caus by thi bug/problem.
