i wouldn't sai i'm new to it, but i'm not experienc. i write littl snippet 
everi now and again and edit system startup file etc.

thi is certainli a challeng though. i guess if i can interfac dyndn.org and 
smsclient rel simpli with option you mention, i'll probabl manag it.

i might also put a check in there for other protocol like http, just in case 
ping happen to be the last protocol stand when the machin or connect is 
about to keel over! (thank to joe in the other msg for the tip)
