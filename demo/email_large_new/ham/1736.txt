  | interest...i don't think thi wa my bug.
  | it appear that msg_chang wa ask to chang to messag "-".

someth like that is quit possibl, but pervious type nonsens
in didn't caus traceback, and now it doe, and the traceback came
from the sequenc code...

pervious thi would have just caus red messag in the statu
line complain about my lousi type.   that's probabl what it
should keep on do (the "red" part isn't import obvious..)
