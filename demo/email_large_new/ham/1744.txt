 true, but that's the think of todai, that the compani mailserv can be
close to you from the outsid; becaus as it is todai you can us ani mail-
server that you've got access to. if there's a good reason for set it up
thei won't be that lazi in the futur.

 a simpl rfc could fix that todai, either us a new header or extend the
receiv-header with a code/valu that the server later on can verifi; mayb
someth like thi:

receiv2: date: [date];
	local: sub.dom2.tld (ip#2);
	remot: sub.dom3.tld (ip#3);
	env-id: 
	code: [cach#, salt hashvalu, rsa or other signatur]

 and then you have the two option from and to, onli ad by the send
server that's identifi the local sender or the server accept mail for a
certain user (to verifi that it did realli come via that server, in case you
forward it us procmail or someth like it).
 you of cours would need some standard for how to check these header.

 not perfect, but better than what we have todai.
