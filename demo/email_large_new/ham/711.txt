can't comment to that. as far as i know 'anyon in the know' would  
have to be appl or the origin to view that radar.
you don't indic the situat where you run into the bug. have you  
consid us anyth besid sun java.util.zip?
thi for on turn up quickli look for (googl)
java.util.zipfil compat

a pure java implement of the java.util.zip librari

http://jazzlib.sourceforg.net/

which in turn mention jzlib which i think i look at befor.

i support some of my own zip relat code but not realli compat  
to zipfil. not do much with it. plan to probabl return to it  
sometim after 1.7 provid the long await pluggabl filesystem.
