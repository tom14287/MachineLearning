a deadlock problemhi xf develop,
when studi xf code(2.4.19), i found that the inod will be lock by 
xf_ilock_share flag befor we get acl, which mai caus deadlock.
becaus when get acl, it will alloc memori in km_sleep, if the 
memori is tight, the process will call xf_strategi, and mai 
lock(xf_ilock_share)the same inod again. if between these two lock, 
anoth process try to lock the inod by xf_ilock_excl, these two 
process  will be deadlock. as follow,

    a process get ea                         b process want lock ipa

1) xf_ilock(ipa, xf_ilock_share)             .....................
            |                                         |
            |                                         |
         get acl                        2) xf_ilock(ipa, xf_ilock_excl)
            |                                         |
            |                                         |
        memori tight
            |
            |
        xf_stragegi
            |
            |
3)xf_ilock(ipa, xf_ilock_share)        ............................

  these two process will be dead lock.

so i believ that acl alloc gfp_maskshould be chang to km_nof.
right?

best regard
                                                 wdd
