i'm not try to load an instanc of the class, i'm try to load the 
actual class definit.  the error is tell me that the java 
classload can't find that class on the classpath (at least that's my 
understand).  what i don't understand is, for it to have call the 
static initi, that mean java ha alreadi load the class 
definit, right?  so why can't it find it?
