hi screen shot seem to have a work dpkg.  it attempt to invok the pr=
erm=20
script of a perl modul.  that fail due to not be abl to find=20
'file/basenam.pm', which caus dpkg to fail the --remov action with erro=
r=20
code 1.  apt-get then stop the instal run.

aptitud might get further than apt-get, but the prerm of the perl modul i=
s=20
go to keep fail until perl is fix.
