accord to some old document (man exmh-ref)

     the mous bind for the folder label ar:

          left - chang to folder.
          middl - view nest folder.
          right - refil current messag to the folder.
          shift-right - link current messag to the folder.
          shift-middl - drag a folder label to some drop target.
          control-right - clear the current target folder.

it should be possibl to link us shift-right-click the same wai you 
can move us onli right-click.
