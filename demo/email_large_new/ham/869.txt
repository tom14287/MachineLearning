unit we fall?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
us airwai score a $500 million bankruptci court bailout.
american airlin announc a re-org. unit airlin' parent
compani's stock sank on specul that ual is next in line for 
chapter 11. it's a wonder none of thi happen last septemb,
but it's not much consol to airlin employe,
sharehold, and custom that it's happen now.

the wall street journal had the most extens coverag of
american's plan as of unspun's deadlin. the airlin will lai
off 7,000 worker, ground some jet, cut back on flight
amen such as food, and retool it hub oper to make
for longer layov. "in the past, airlin were loath to have
longer connect time becaus flight were list in travel
agent' comput by elaps time," said the journal. "now,
onlin book tool and search engin most often list flight
by price, not time." in thi ag of penni-pinch, american's
worri about low-cost carrier, not the big gui like, um, us
air and unit. 

speak of unit, it's hard to come up with a verb for it
parent compani's stock that doesn't invok an air disast.
let's just sai it didn't go up yesterdai. the $3.80 share price
mai be the least of ual's worri while it wait for an
increasingli unlik $1.8 billion loan from the air
transport stabil board. "the atsb expect an
applic's worker, supplier and creditor to make concess 
to help the airlin repai the loan and thu protect u.s.
taxpay' interest," said the l.a. time. sound nice for
uninvolv taxpay but not so good to some of unit's union, 
which ar balk at a wage cut. worker did enough by defer 
$498 million in retroact pai thi year, said the
36,000-member machinist' union. analyst moan in anti-labor
frustrat. 

the basic problem here is too mani empti airplan seat, and
non-u.s. outlet didn't have a lot of sympathi. "the u.s.
govern ha bail out carrier with insur subsidi and
feder loan guarante" while "european author have act
more wise," let swissair and sabena "go to the wall," said 
the financi time. canadian pundit agre that america should 
let a coupl of airlin wilt, sinc the canadian airlin
industri benefit from the demis of canadian airlin and
canada 3000. page charl darwin to the white courtesi

sleep with the penguin
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the linuxworld confer and expo, which open yesterdai in
san francisco, will host two of the strangest bedfellow ever to 
lie down with a stuf penguin: microsoft and sun. these ar
compani that onc refer to linux as a "bathtub of code"
(sun) and "a cancer" (microsoft), accord to sun's hometown
paper the san jose mercuri new.

both compani ar take linux serious despit the absolut
number. by januari 2, 2001, microsoft had made as much on
server softwar as all linux vendor put togeth would reap in
the entir year.

honor for the best attent-grabber on microsoft's presenc at 
the show go to brier dudlei, who open hi piec for the
seattl time thi wai: "microsoft execut peter houston
wasn't too worri about the recept he'd get at linuxworld
... until he heard about the pie cannon."

wire inform us that the section of linuxworld where microsoft 
will be hold the fort is dub the rookeri -- "a place where 
you can watch compani hatch and grow right befor your ey,"
deadpan report michel delio, quot microsoft's houston: 
"hatch isn't exactli on the agenda, but i certainli hope to
grow."

turn to sun, unspun note that five year ago a joke press
releas circul on the net claim that linux creator linu
torvald, then still live in finland, wa move to silicon
vallei to work for sun. the joke wa that sun had decid to
scrap it solari oper system and instead concentr on a
version of linux, to be call "solinux." how time doe make
april fool of us all: linu torvald is now thrive in silicon 
vallei (at transmeta), and yesterdai sun microsystem
demonstr sun linux 5.0. and introduc it first
gener-purpos server run linux.

the merc ran a comprehens wrap of sun's evolv attitud
toward the upstart oper system. sun ha littl choic but
to embrac linux, wrote report theres poletti, becaus some
of it tradit wall street custom were desert it.
"sever invest bank have toss out whole section of sun
server and replac them with intel-base server run
linux," poletti report. and you thought microsoft hate linux?
