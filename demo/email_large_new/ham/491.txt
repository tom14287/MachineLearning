lilo; so it's easi to overlook.

at thi point, you onli have two kernel instal; so there's noth to
purg right now.  but be sure to add the option flag to the linuxold
section in /etc/lilo.conf.  without it, lilo will gener an error if
there ar not at least two kernel instal.

well, i alreadi have, sort of.  the troubl is that it's buri in a
larger document on custom kernel build.  peopl see that and think,
"oh, i'm not build a custom kernel; so i don't need to read thi."
but step 10 on my kernel build page

   http://www.wowwai.com/~zlinuxman/kernel.htm

talk about custom the kernel instal environ, and that
part is applic to both stock and custom kernel.  the instruct
for custom the lenni environ work for squeez also, provid
that you us *onli* stock kernel.  the minut you introduc a custom
kernel, you *must* us the hook script, as document in the squeez
section.

as i explain in anoth post, ye, it is in sid.  if you need
instruct for how to pull in the sid kernel without upgrad
your whole system to sid, let me know and i can provid that.
also, you might try disabl acpi and try the vesa driver,
as explain in anoth post.
