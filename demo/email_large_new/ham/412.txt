it didn't us to point to the appl user group resourc site... but  
now that it doe, thi is actual a good thing.

no longer do the appl user group advisori board have to wait for the  
appl webmast(s) to be avail to updat thing like the list of  
user group... or the variou special thei organ on behalf of user  
group... thei can do it themselv immedi.

it also highlight the fact that user group ar independ entiti  
from appl themselv... and that independ can be a good thing
