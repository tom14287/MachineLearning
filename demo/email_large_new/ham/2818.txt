 from the hard disk upgrad mini howto :

8. prepar lilo to boot the new disk

   (thank to rick master for help with thi.)

   we're  assum  that lilo is instal on the hard disk's master boot
   record (mbr); thi seem to be the most common configur. you want
   to  instal  lilo  on  what's  present the second hard disk but will
   becom the first hard disk.

   edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follow:

        disk=/dev/hdb bio=0x80       # tell lilo to treat the second
                                      # disk as if it were the first
                                      # disk (bio id 0x80).
        boot=/dev/hdb                 # instal lilo on second hard
                                      # disk.
        map=/new-disk/boot/map        # locat of "map file".
        instal=/new-disk/boot/boot.b # file to copi to hard disk's
                                      # boot sector.
        prompt                        # have lilo show "lilo boot:"
                                      # prompt.
        timeout=50                    # boot default system after 5
                                      # second. (valu is in tenth of
                                      # second.)
        imag=/new-disk/boot/vmlinuz  # locat of linux kernel. the
                                      # actual name mai includ a version
                                      # number, for exampl
                                      # "vmlinuz-2.0.35".
            label=linux               # label for linux system.
            root=/dev/hda1            # locat of root partit on
                                      # new hard disk. modifi thi as
                                      # appropri for your system.
                                      # note that you must us the name
                                      # of the futur locat, onc the
                                      # old disk ha been remov.
            read-onli                 # mount partit read-onli at
                                      # first, to run fsck.
