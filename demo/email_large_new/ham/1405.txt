do you realli think thi is true?  i ad a modifi time check think that 
it would make an improv sinc we were read it a *lot* more time in 
the new code becaus we're try to us the sequenc.

on the other hand, the sequenc file ar probabl be read out of cach 
when that happen anywai.

even with a small file, i'd think that the time taken to do a 
[file mtime $filenam] would be worth it.  my code is in proc mhreadseq.
