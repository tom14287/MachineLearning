agre.

but i have alwai thought that the valu 5 wa not the best valu.  it
should have been 0.  i understand that initi onli spammi score
were includ.  but i believ the algorithm should be pure
symmetr and non-spammi neg valu should also have been
balanc out the spammi posit valu, like thei do in sa todai.
then anyth that wa posit would be spam and anyth neg
would be non-spam.  (and i guess exactli zero is grei. :-) todai's
choic of 5 just add an offset.  which i think caus peopl to assum
thing work differ than thei do.
