[razor-user] re: can't call method "log" with sa/razor2thi is happen due to insuffici write access to the
"razor-agent.log" file. i wa get the same error, but
onli as a non-root user.  as a quick workaround, you can do
"chmod go+w razor-agent.log".

in agent.pm, when then the logger object is creat, it
doesn't check whether the logfil is writabl by the current
user. then, when a write attempt is made, it bail out with
the "unbless refer" error.

hope that help,
michael
