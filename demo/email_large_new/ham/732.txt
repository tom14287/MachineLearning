how doe the finder decid that two drive ar on the same
	partit?when i make two "local" disk via macfus and i try to eject on of them =
the finder insist on warn me that there ar two drive on the same =
partit, and give me the option to unmount all of them or just the =
on i tri to. thi is veri inconveni for me.

the mount command show:


myf@fuse0 on /volum/myf_2gig (...)
myf@fuse1 on /volum/myf_4gig (...)

my suspicion is that the finder just look for the mount=46rom valu =
then call volum partit on the same disk if thei onli vari in the =
last number.

thought?

thank,
jim o'connor=
