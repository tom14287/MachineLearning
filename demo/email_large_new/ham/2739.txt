  | ever tri to get mh to *not* have a 'pseq' sequenc?

hmm - i've been us mh for a long time (sinc well befor there were
sequenc) and i don't think i've ever seen a "pseq" ...

i'm guess that that's the sequenc that you have "pick" creat
as i recal it, it ha no default sequenc name, so the sequenc name
that peopl us will tend to vari from person to person won't thei
(except as mh configur move around institut by osmosi).

i've alwai us "sel" for that purpos.

i kind of doubt that ani pre built-in sequenc name is go to be
veri gener.   even "unseen" can be chang (fortun that on
is easi to find in the mh profil - though whether exmh doe that,
os just us "unseen" i haven't bother to find out).
