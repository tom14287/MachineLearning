on practic i've adopt is to list requir: onli when thei're
absolut necessari.  thi will help becaus some packag ar name
differ between distribut (eg. sdl <-> libsdl), and the
depend ar automat handl by rpm by depend on share
librari name.

thi doesn't appli to buildrequir: though.

us macro for directori name where avail, eg %{_libdir},
%{_bindir}, %{_datadir} etc.

i'd like to suggest us as mani rpm macro for command name as
possibl too, but unfortun i don't know of a definit refer
about them...

i have a small redhat 7.3 rpm/apt repositori at
, and i've receiv report from peopl
run mandrak 8.x and suse that the rpm work with them out of the
box.
