re: [ilug] hard- vs. soft-link [wa: how to copi some file ]us the gui and don't delet file, us the other option, what it call
again, the dustbin or someth ;-)

conor who onli know about symbol link ;-))

i'm pretti sure that i have a softlink from
/mnt/public/mnt/public/download/linux/wastecpu/setiathom to
/home/cwynn/seti

the /mnt/pub....../seti.. directori resid on an extern raidvolum and
/home/../seti is on the intern id2 drive. 
so i dont have to cd around the gaf. i suppos that would count as across
differ devic. 

if you're wonder [probabl not] why /mnt/public is there twice, it
becaus i restor from tapebackup and i didn't know that it keep the
directori structur. i know now ;-)

actual, how can i fix that quickli and easili? i thought about firstli
mv'ing the structur to /tmp. then copi it back again but i'm sure some
wee geniu know a quicki solut. mind you i never even bother try a
it not a prioriti now that it all link anywai.

--------------------------------
 hum.  interest variat on the classic techniqu of
 redefin `rm' to `mv' the file into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variat
 ar endless).  these classic techniqu onli provid a
 mean to roll back accident `rm's, so there is still
 consider scope for data lost as there ar other wai
 of delet file --- which is not a problem for thi
 hard link idea.

 but, like the classic techniqu, there is no roll
 back of accident overwrit.

 ( roll back overwrit remind me of the "snapshot"
  facil on network applianc fileserv.  and of the
  variou "version" filesystem which appear --- and
  then vanish? --- over the year.... )

 on sever(?) gotcha is some file shouldn't have ani
 hard link.  both rc *,v (and henc cv) and scc s.*
 file ar like thi --- the rc(/cv?)/scc toolset
 complain if there ar hard link.

cheer,
