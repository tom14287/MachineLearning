i do not agre, sorri. pdflatex gener write bigger pdf, simpli
becaus there is no compress (consid for exampl
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2004-june/005046.html). moreov, i
think that pstrick doe not work with pdflatex (you need to us pdftrick=
s).

i also vagu rememb about mani situat where, if i had had to us
pdflatex, i would not have been abl to produc the same document,
becaus i would have had to chang mani packag which were incompat.=


you might ask on comp.text.tex, thi is a better place for thi, becaus
thi is my point of view, and it is not share by the whole commun.
