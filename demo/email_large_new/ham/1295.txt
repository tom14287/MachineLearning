there shouldn't be ani long-term implic as long as the old kresourc
code still exist.  i'm assum it's be deprec as of kde 4.4, but
i'd be surpris if it's remov in kde 4.5, especi sinc delai
migrat is an offici recommend.

onc the db mess is sort out (kde 4.5?), on can manual migrat the
data by run "kre-migrat".  i actual did thi accident.  the
migrat _might_ also run if we remov the configur bit, but i've not
tri.

it extend beyond just a chang in packag behavior, it's a non-revers
and potenti aggrav alter to user data.  i've seen similar
warn befor, most recent to rebuild openoffic.org .rdb file due to
possibl corrupt.

forgot to mention befor, appar there's an innodb_log_wait counter
that increment when you have write burst that exce the redo log size.
it can be us for feedback to increas the log size if need.  perhap
someth to suggest manual do in new.
