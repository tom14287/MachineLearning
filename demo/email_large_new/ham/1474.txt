that boil down to "it's on by default". just go turn them off. and
the default do not have wobbl window, wavi effect, or anyth
shimmer. noth spin either, but the alt-tab dialogu doe slide.
there is plenti of transpar, though, and i hate that too. so i
turn it off.

my mother suffer from what she call "vertigo" and the effect do not
upset her. nor do thei upset the autist that i volunt with. thei
ar mere an annoy to those annoi by them, noth wild.
