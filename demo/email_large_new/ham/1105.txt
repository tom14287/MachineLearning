what need to improv in kde 4?pleas tell us what problem, bug, or issu kde 4 that make it
difficult to us. pleas be veri specif so that bug can be file
and the softwar can be fix. gener statement such as "kde4 sux"
ar not welcom, as thei do not give ani indic as to what can be
fix.

comparison to kde 3 ar welcom, but pleas do not simpli state
"should be like kde 3". rather, pleas state how kde 4 behav, and
how you would prefer it to behav (even if that mean describ in
detail kde 3 behaviour).

my intent is to file issu and get bug fix, not to fight.
nobodi is order to particip in thi thread, but all ar welcom.
