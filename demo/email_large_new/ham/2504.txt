if file integr ar import to you, look for a fs that keep 
checksum of individu file.  otherwis, if a file becom corrupt, 
you'll never know it, unless you keep your own checksum.  there ar 
onli a small hand of filesystem that keep checksum of your file.  
btrf and zf come to mind.  i believ zf is more matur than btrf, 
but it isn't in the kernel.  i believ the onli wai to get zf on linux 
is through fuse.

there's also jf, which ha been around for a number of year, and is 
matur.  it doesn't checksum your file, but it doe us copi-on-write 
(as do btrf and zf), which goe a long wai to keep your data from 
get corrupt, someth xf doe not do.

so if btrf were more matur, or if zf were includ in the kernel, i'd 
recommend either of those.  but as it is, i think jf is the wai to go.
