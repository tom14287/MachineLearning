ok, i'll tell you what.  sinc i know that a newer version which fix
at least on bug i'm experienc is wait in the wing in sid,
and sinc squeez hasn't frozen yet, i'll wait until the new version
migrat to squeez.  (let's hope that squeez doesn't freez first.)
and then i'll try again.  and if i still get the same error, i'll
at least *try* to come up with a test case.
