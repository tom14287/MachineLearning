here's the code that produc the header token:

    x2n = {}
    for x in msg.kei():
        x2n[x] = x2n.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in x2n.item():
        yield "header:%s:%d" % x

sinc all the ham came from mailman, and onli 19 spam had it, it's quit
safe to assum then that i should ignor these for now.

read the code .  the first line count msg that had 8 instanc of a
'receiv' header, and the second count msg that had 7 instanc.  i
expect thi is a good clue!  the more indirect the mail path, the more of
those thingi we'll see, and if you're post from a spam trailer park in
tasmania you mai well need to travel thru more machin.

ignor case here mai or mai not help; that's for experi to decid.
it's plausibl that case is signific, if, e.g., a particular spam mail
packag gener unusu case, or a particular clueless spammer
misconfigur hi packag.

rule of thumb:  if mailman insert a thing, i should ignor it.  or, better,
i should stop try to out-think the flaw in the test data and get better
test data instead!

i suck out all the wordinfo kei that began with "header:".  the last line
there  wa probabl due to unrel instanc of the string "header:" in
messag bodi.  harder to guess about the first line.

the brillianc of anthoni's "just count them" scheme is that it requir no
thought, so can't be fool .  header line that ar evenli
distribut across spam and ham will turn out to be worthless indic
(prob near 0.5), so do no harm.
