and yet, in my experi, it still happen, but alwai "unoffici"
and "off the record".  it's as if we believ that "the god" will
punish us if we ar seen to have behav in a human fashion while on
compani time, either by be caught red-hand, or have the
paper-trail finger us later.  yet even ceo will "pull string" to
make thing happen, and, also in my experi, those ar the moment
when thing actual do happen.
