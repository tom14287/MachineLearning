let me "copi/past" from the offici announcemnet¹:

***
"(...) for thi reason, nvidia is drop support, on new gpu, for the
xf86-video-nv driver.

detail:

- nvidia will continu to support the exist function and
exist level of acceler in the nv driver for exist gpu,
on exist, and (within reason) futur, x server version.

- nvidia will not support the xf86-video-nv driver on fermi or
later gpu.

- nvidia will not support displayport, on ani gpu, in the
 xf86-video-nv driver."
***

so i think the "nv" driver will keep the same "bug|featur" that ha 
right now and will still get some secur patch, but i'm afraid that's 
all we (linux user) can expect.
