  if you see "aptitud safe-upgrad" try to upgrad durep, i'd like
to see the output of these command (after you type control-c at the
aptitud prompt, of cours):

aptitud show durep
aptitud -sy --show-resolv-action safe-upgrad

  that shouldn't be possibl.  if it is happen, someth is veri
wrong.  my own guess is that someth is clear your hold flag.  for
instanc, it wa recent point out to me that "aptitud keep-all"
clear hold flag (probabl wrongli).
