for now it ha happen twice ... it could be that i have
instal/configur someth after log in the first time. 

what is happen perman is that if i click the logout button the whole
desktop freez. i have to press ctrl+alt+f[1-6] to restart kdm

what i am miss now is also the old behavior from ctrl+alt+del to get
prompt for reboot or shutdown - or whatev. now thi combin is
lock the screen. wa it adopt from newer window?

well, 
- kplayer wa not work for dvb input.
- korgan doe not start
- kweather and kmoon ar not visibl (can not choos to activ), though it
state it's instal.

- all kde app like kplayer/organ and probabl other start veri slowli
about 20-30sec to pop up


i'm sorri but i can not test anyth that fast. it will take few week.

i will probabl test upgrad (as i said) from lenni to squeez to sid. to
simul an upgrad of my current system. i think thi is more import.
thi will take a while, so my plan for now is to see what basic work
and what not.
