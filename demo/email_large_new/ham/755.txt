re: debian+kde 4.4.3 (i915 dual screen) (solv)
 xserver ha a well known issu with the i915 driver and it's dri/drm 
  limit to 2048x2048 window size. so the default setup is not work 
  becaus in recent version of x it load drm by default creat 
  configur that allow onli  "clone" of the primari displai with dri 
  enabl on it.
  the impact on kde is that it can not set dual displai (onli "clone" option 
  is avail).
  solv: appli custom xorg.conf with 
        option "noaccel" "true"
  in the devic section and posit option into each monitor config.
