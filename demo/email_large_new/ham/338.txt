too rich for my blood. by that i mean that nvidia-glx with thi quadro 
card ha caus all sort of odd breakag and unreli issu in 
the de. i have done enough experi with ident configur 
of xfce and gnome on thi system, with the onli differ be us of 
differ video driver (vesa, nv, glx/restrict) under both ubuntu and 
debian to know that it's not my imagin. i'd rather have a reliabl 
system than 3d, so glx is a no go for me. the vesa driver ha been 
absolut flawless, but quit slow, of cours. the slow ha been 
worth it becaus absolut noth in the user interfac ha ever been 
broken sinc i went to vesa. i don't game, and i've just learn to be 
patient when switch workspac.

;)

i'm look forward to see if nouveau will be an improv, 
perform-wise, without caus reliabl issu.

i am, howev, go to wait and instal nouveau the easi wai, onc the 
upgrad to xserver-xorg-core becom avail in the repositori. if 
thi weren't my main system i might be tempt to experi, but i just 
need thi thing to keep work.
