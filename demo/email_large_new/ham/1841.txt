 ye. especi in the languag he wa talk about - c, pascal and
assembl. goto's can be us well; there ar a few us in the kernel
code to improv effic. thei ar almost requir in some languag
(like c) where 'break' or 'continu' can't be told how mani loop/switch
to break out of.

 but, in gener, goto's make a mess of code.

 recurs is onli trueli us if you have an infinit stack. peopl
that think thei have an infinit stack shouldn't be let near a compil.
