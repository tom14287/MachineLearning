i think that thi is a bug, but i don't know where.  i'm
guess that it ha someth to do with km in newer kernel.
but that's just a guess.  i do a lot of work in the text
consol.  i often us an 80x50 video mode
(via the vga option of lilo), which gener
work everywher.  anywai, i wa not happi with the font provid
by consol-setup; and i want to go back to the legaci font that ar
us by lenni.  i open
a thread on thi forum about the problem
(http://list.debian.org/debian-user/2009/12/msg01438.html) and
got a satisfactori resolut.  here's what i would recommend
that you try.  first, make sure that the consol-data packag
is instal.  then, in /etc/default/consol-setup, set

   fontfac=""
   fontsiz=""

then add

   font=lat1u-16.psf.gz

in my case, i us lat1u-08.psf.gz as the font, sinc the 80x50 video
mode requir an eight-pixel-high font; but in your case, sinc you
appar us the tradit vga boot-up hardwar text mode
(no framebuff, i presum), you will need the sixteen-pixel-high
font.

give that a whirl and see how it goe.  thi method give a larger
select of font to choos from.  (lat1u-16 is a suggest,
but there ar other sixteen-pixel-high font you can choos from.
see the /usr/share/consolefont directori for a complet list.)
and in my opinion, these font look better too.  but most importantli,
thi method mai circumv the bug you ar experienc.  if it
doe circumv the bug, consol-setup is the most suspect packag.
