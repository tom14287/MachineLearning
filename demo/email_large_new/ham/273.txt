the current version of the limbo beta is 7.3.93 (yeah, thei should
have renam it, but thei didn't). it's in the same
redhat/linux/beta/limbo directori on the ftp server. just check the
redhat-releas packag to find out which version is on the server. 
look at ftp.redhat.com, the current on is redhat-releas-7.3.93-2.

if you're us gnome2 from the beta, i'd upgrad as there were some
import bugfix sinc the first beta. the onli thing to watch out
for is that limbo2 switch gcc to 3.2, which is onc again
incompat with the previou gcc (v3.1 ship in limbo1).
