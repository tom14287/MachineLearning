nv - debian squeez

gave up final in decemb last year try to get the blob to work 
reliabl. thei're simpli not worth the effort for someon with my 
particular need.

i'm reason happi with the system with the nvidia workstat card. 
but the cheaper system with intel and ati graphic ar faster and 
handl ani special effect i might want (like occasion us of desktop 
composit) better, and i'm happier with them. nvidia is simpli not on 
my radar for ani futur system becaus i consid their approach to 
linux to be inim to foss.

ps: my apolog. recent updat to my mail client coupl with lack of 
sleep. i accident sent ron a direct e-mail repli. mea culpa.
