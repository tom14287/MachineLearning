i know noth about citrix client o:-), but found thi forum thread:

***
french keyboard layout problem us german charact  
http://forum.citrix.com/thread.jspa?threadid=252710&tstart;=0
***

us the same client version (v11) and have a same (similar?) issu. 
the onli differ is that the user seem to be us a window version 
of the citrix client.

have you check if there is a newer version of the citrix client? :-?

also, in thi¹ faq sai:

***
incorrect keystrok ar displai when i us the keyboard

if you ar us a non-english languag keyboard, the screen displai mai 
not match the keyboard input. in thi case, you should specifi the 
keyboard type and layout that you ar us. for more inform about 
specifi keyboard, see configur keyboard option, alert sound, and 
digit dictat support.
