ipfw wa written specif for freebsd under a bsd licens by luigi
rizzo, who's on of the freebsd whizz.  all three of the bsd's
packag ipfilt, which ha been around for donkei year and which ha
a slightli differ featur set to ipfw.

howev, last year the author of ipfilt (darren reed) chang the
licens on develop branch of ipfilt to prohibit redistribut,
although offici releas would still be kept under the old licens. 
thi polici got up the nose of theo de raadt (lot of thing do, which
is why openbsd exist in the first place), so openbsd re-invent the
wheel and call their firewal "pf", under a full-time bsd licens.   

the standard releas version of ipfilt ar unencumb, as alwai.

i'm not so sure that ipfw2 is realli readi for product yet, have
onli been mfc'd last wednesdai.  it certainli add some nice syntact
sugar, and is appar much faster for certain type of complex
ruleset.  it will be good onc it's had some time to settl down a
littl.

ipfilt is quit nice, and is my current o/s firewal of choic.  it
ha some nice featur like the abil to save and restor state so
that connect ar persist across reboot, and it log is
margin better organis than ipfw's.  it's also veri matur code,
which appeal to the rather conserv tast of my old ag.
