re: [ilug] adsl router modem comboit seem to onli support pppoa and not pppoe. you need on that support
pppoe, if you want torun it in rout ip mode. if you ar us it as a
bridg, it'll probabl work, but you'd be left leav the comput on,
which would defeat the purpos of get a router.

the best router i've come accross is the zyxel 643. eircom suppli thi,
but if you have alook onlin you can probabl find it cheaper to bui
onlin from america or the uk.

hope thi is us,
joe
