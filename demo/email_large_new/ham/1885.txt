i had been hand build those alsa packag for probabl 6 month or more, so i
could us my laptop's ess chip best (hard disk record and such). wow, mayb 8 to
10 month, time fly. i didn't look forward to do that tediou build everi time i
chang a kernel or someth. matthia ha made thi a thing of the past! dude,
it's a no brainer, us apt-get or just download and instal.

what's more, oss is fulli "imit", older app us oss ar as happi as a clam.
my person tast tell me newer app which us alsa sound better (alsaplay, xmm
with alsa modul) to my ear.

the 2 thing that trick peopl ar the modul.conf file, thei didn't have that
automat matrix page when i start with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.

and on my old instal (onli the first time i instal it on a clean box), alsa
alwai wa "mute" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. it's possibl
matthia even took care of that too. anywai it is/wa onli a on time thing on 1st
instal, that wa a long time ago for me.

those alsa dude had been try to get it into the 2.4 kernel but miss it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the futur of sound in the linux kernel.

that's "angl" as in geometri.
