i don't know of ani backport binari, so you would have to compil it
yourself. that, howev, would be a major undertak, and presuppos
that the latest kde4 even compil against the version of the variou
librari includ in lenni.

an altern is to upgrad to test/unstabl, but then you would no
longer have the uncompl life of a lenni user :-)

or you could wait for the next stabl releas, or at least for the
freez announc.
