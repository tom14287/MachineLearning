_joe gregorio_: my next pet project[1]. “try to re-creat the "good 
easi[2]" on a window machin.” i have also made half-heart attempt in 
thi direct, as i am forc to us window dure the dai. i sai 
half-heart becaus i'm still applic-centric, and i don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcut as i could. but i don't us the desktop at all (never have, 
on ani system), and i don't us ctrl alt keyboard shortcut becaus i 
person find them awkward (ymmv). if you must us window, the first step 
toward a product system is manag your start menu. 

i us the main level of the start menu with number shortcut to my most 
common program. "0 control panel[3]", "1 mozilla[4]", "2 emac[5]", "3 do 
home", "4 do work", "5 do incom" (each of which give me a command line, 
but in differ directori), "7 python[6]", "9 ie". also "# explor home", 
"$ explor work", "% explor incom", which open explor window in 
variou us directori (the same directori as the do shortcut, onli 
with the shift kei held down, and ye, i intention set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). less-us program ar taken out of their useless submenu 
(as instal) and move directli into the program submenu and given uniqu 
first letter as need. "ad-awar[7]", "excel[8]", "im", "netscap 4[9]", 
"paint shop pro", "queri tool (odbc)[10]", "vmware[11]", "word[12]". all other 
submenu except startup ar remov from the program menu. (ye, delet 
"accessori". do you honestli ever us it? if so, it's probabl a sign of a 
larger product problem.) thing which never need to be run manual (like 
winzip and quicktim) ar remov from the program menu. maintain a clean 
program menu is an ongo struggl, but well worth it. 

on most modern keyboard, there is a kei next to your left alt kei that open 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without take your 
finger off the home kei. otherwis ctrl esc alwai work. menu 4 give me a 
new command prompt in my work directori. menu p n run netscap 4 (for 
compat test in my dai job, ugh). mozilla and emac ar almost alwai 
open, but i quit lesser-us applic as soon as i'm done us them 
(mostli becaus my laptop doesn't have a lot of memori). 

i instal cygwin[13] so that the command line is actual us. cygwin is a 
collect of window port of all your favorit unix util, includ mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cv, and mani other. and 
bash, which i don't us becaus i dislik how it handl window pathnam. i 
also set the properti of my command line shortcut to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. set window posit at 0 x 0, and don't let the system posit the 
window. 

in mozilla, i set my home page to "about:blank", set internet search to search 
with googl, us tab brows, open tab instead of window in all possibl 
case, alwai show the tab bar, and load link in the background (essenti for 
weblog surf, you can ctrl click link to open them in new tab in the 
background). under script & plugin, i do not allow script to open 
unrequest window. i turn off the sidebar, turn on the site navig bar, 
delet all pre-instal bookmark, and creat two bookmark: on which take 
me to my webmail, and anoth which take me to my intern site search[14], 
from which i can find all other bookmark i need. 

in internet explor, i set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, sinc 
that's the onli thing i do in internet explor. alt tab back and forth between 
mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tab within mozilla, 
sinc textarea in mozilla lose focu when you switch tab, make copi and 
past weblog entri virtual imposs. 

i us emac local and vi remot, becaus the default behavior of emac is 
so heinou as to render it unus. (for instanc, edit a cgi script name 
foo.cgi on a web server with emac would gener a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readabl and is sent as plain text to ani browser that ask. try thi 
sometim on your favorit web site.) among other thing, my .emac file (which 
is actual call _emac on window) instruct emac to store all backup file 
in a singl directori (d:\backup); to treat all xml file as docbook, all cgi 
script as python, and all sql script as pl/sql; to us cygwin's bash shell 
for m-x-shell; to us a singl maxim frame with no menubar, titl as the 
name of the current file; to show column number; to accept "y" and "n" for 
ye/no question; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
i press m-w. i us some weird registri hack and a hack notepad.ex to get 
all text file to open in emac. (i got thi idea from ultraedit[15].) my 
_emac file is my second most back-up possess. 

i don't us window' useless directori structur for user home directori. on 
my d drive i have d:\home (contain directori for my book and other person 
project, each under cv control—also set as my home directori us the 
home environ variabl), d:\work (contain directori for each work 
project, also under cv), d:\incom (set as default download directori for 
all program that download thing), and d:\backup (us by emac, and for 
temporari storag, for instanc for store origin when check out newli 
creat cv project). i don't know or care what's where on my c drive. 

i have tri mani, mani address book, and still store all my contact, email 
address, snail mail address, phone number, and other vital person 
inform in a text file call phone, store in d:\home\phone. it is not in 
ani particular format, other than be plain text and usual includ blank 
line between entri. i categor peopl with simpl keyword in parenthes 
after their name, and us m-x-occur in emac to search by keyword. thi file is 
my singl most back-up possess. 

other essenti free window util i us (in no particular order): tweakui
[16], cygwin[17], guidescop[18], zonealarm[19].
