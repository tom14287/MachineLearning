i'm not familiar with your laptop, but most laptop have a wai to switch
back and forth between the intern displai and an extern displai via
the intern keyboard.  on the ibm thinkpad machin that i us (a 600
and a 390e) it is fn+f7.  consult your hardwar document.

switch between the two is much easier if your extern monitor
is an lcd monitor.  the intern displai probabl run at 60 hz vertic
refresh.  the extern monitor, if it is an lcd displai, will probabl
want to run at 60 hz vertic refresh also.  an extern crt monitor,
howev, will probabl have notic flicker at 60 hz vertic refresh.
it will want to us a higher vertic refresh rate: at least 72 hz.

switch back and forth dynam between intern and extern monitor
is tricki if thei want to us differ resolut and refresh rate.
it often won't work.
