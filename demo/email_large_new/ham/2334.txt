hello there. i own a dell studio 1555 with an ati mobil radeon hd4570. i
have a debian test instal and current i have to us either radeon
or the radeonhd driver caus the proprietari (fglrx) driver doesn't support
the xserver current avail in test. everyth work just fine. i
even got 3d acceler and kwin effect. the problem is that the xorg
process is us the cpu and consum much memori. the memori consum is
about 160mb but that doesn't realli bother me caus i got plenti of it :p.
well the annoi thing is the cpu fan; xorg us about 10% (as shown in
kde's system monitor) and so the fan doe never stop. ha anyon els
spot ani high cpu usag when us those driver? if i disabl the kde
effect the memori consumpt get lower but the cpu is still in heavi us
by the xorg process.


well i got a few more question about these open sourc driver. doe anyon
know if thei have power save enabl? i think when i us the fgrlx driver
the batteri last much longer. i also got an issu with suspend. it work
with the fglrx driver but with the opensourc driver the laptop doesn't
wake up. well it doe but the displai show noth. i have to plai with
alt+ctrl+f* befor it show someth. then if i type my pass i can see that
the s2ram process is consum 50% of the cpu! on time when do so the
laptop turn off by itself. i think it overh so that make me think that
someth goe wrong with the acpi after wake up from suspend.

sorri for the long post. thank in advanc for ani help.
