doesn't defeat thi system at all. if you see that onc, feed it into 
your bayesian classifi, and it classifi the url us for the 
imag. then next time it see on, it know with almost 100% accuraci 
that an email with on of those url is definit spam.

in mani wai thi is like razor, which is why i'm hack on a 
distribut system to do thi, to see if it's feasibl to scale it global.
