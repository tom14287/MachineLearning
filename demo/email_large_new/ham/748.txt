strang issu after upgrad to latest 10.6.3hi folk,

i *think* thi happen after upgrad to 10.6.3, but i also recal
there wa a secur patch, i apolog becaus i wa sort of
absentmindedli updat myself which i hadn't done in a while.  so...er,
not exactli sure what the caus is.  but, the issu is thi:

when i'm us x11/xquartz (i've just tri the default xterm as well as
rxvt i instal via macport), what seem to happen is that i can open
a termin and us it for a littl while, but if i leav x11, that is if
it loos focu, and then i come back, i can no longer switch between
window, enter anyth with the keyboard, click and select window with
my mous, etc.  all input to x11 seem to be dead.  i have to kill it
and then restart it again to get it to work at all, and then the same
thing happen.  i've tri reinstal it but that hasn't help.

doe thi behavior ring a bell to anyon?  ani help would be greatli
appreci, i live in rxvt and don't like us termin.app veri much!

thank--

dave
