you could read about regular express.
^kernel$ match "kernel" and nothimg more.
kern, kernel-smp and kernel-enterpris ar the kernel packag you
might be run in a rh system. packag like kernel-header,
kernel-boot and kernel-doc aren't match. if it just said "kernel", it
would match *all* those packag.
