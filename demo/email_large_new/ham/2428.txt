re: 2.5.0 weirdnessok. i have sinc verifi that sometim i lose focu and sometim x11 pop
to the front even when anoth applic is rune. for exampl, i'm us
powerpoint, and then...gee, all my xterm. hello, xterm. but powerpoint
still ha "focu" in the sens that my keypress go to powerpoint, which is
hidden behind my xterm.

but here's the thing--thi all start with 2.5.0. thi bug is not present
in the snow leopard standard instal. so perhap there *is* someth
xquartz.app can do about it?
