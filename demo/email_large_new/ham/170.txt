   the  web  server. under some circumst, an intrud mai be abl to
   take  advantag  of  thi  flaw  to  execut  arbitrari  code with the
   privileg of the web server.

   you  mai  be  awar that free memori at inappropri time in some
   implement  of  malloc  and  free  doe not usual result in the
   execut  of  arbitrari  code.  howev, becaus php util it own
   memori  manag  system,  the  implement of malloc and free is
   irrelev to thi problem.
