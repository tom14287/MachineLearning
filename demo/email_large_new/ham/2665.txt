i don't think there's much more room for lower fp left which the ga can 
achiev.  rememb, also, that the awl will reduc fp, but it effect aren't 
factor in to the ga score.

the work current be done on the ga, and compar differ method of 
do the score-set, is veri worthwhil, and extrem us; howev, we 
realli ought to get a releas out, sinc 2.31 is get decreasingli us as 
time goe on.

the fp/fn rate of 2.40 with pretti well *ani* score-set mechan will be 
better than 2.31 -- we can continu with adjust how the score ar set on the 
2.41 or 2.50 branch.

you could just allow low and high to be evolv by the ga (within rang); i'd 
be enorm surpris if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, sinc 
that'd give the ga the broadest lattitud in set individu score.  the 
issu with fix low and high is not on of optim, but rather on of 
human-base concern that individu score larger than about +4 ar danger 
and liabl to gener fp, and individu score less than -8 ar danger and 
liabl to be forg to gener fn.

dq> mayb even add a nybia loop.

ad an nybia loop is not worthwhil -- chang nybia score will just 
alter the evalu function's idea of what the fp:fn ratio should be.

i've been search for that, but i guess the detail of where the channel wa
