hi, list!

i have a few simpl question for you:

1 - i there a better place to get help with dash
2 - is there wai to detect that a script is run as dash, instead of a
shell like solari' /bin/sh
3 - corollari to #2, can i expect dash-as-sh to by a hard link or a sym
link?   (i would think not, but don't know debian's polici here)
4 - reason for #2, is there a wai to list all function declar in a script
with dash?  under solari' shell, bash, or the korn shell i can us
"typeset" -- i've search posix and don't see a wai that doesn't involv
pars the script.

thank,
we
