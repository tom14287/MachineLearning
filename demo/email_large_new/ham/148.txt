feedback from my post[1] about fogbugz[2] setup fell into four categori. 

*"why make setup revers? instead you should collect all the inform 
from the user and make all the chang in on batch at the end."* there ar a 
coupl of thing to understand here. first of all, even if you do everyth in 
on batch at the end, there's alwai a possibl that some step in the middl 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behav setup program will 
back out the step that were alreadi done. there ar well over 100 error 
messag in the string tabl for fogbugz setup so the number of thing that can 
fail is not insignific. 

second, it's not nice to tell peopl about an error in their input three page 
after thei made the mistak. for exampl, earli in the fogbugz setup process we 
prompt you to creat an account for fogbugz to us: 

[img: http://www.joelonsoftwar.com/pictur/setupnewacct.gif (fogbugz setup 
screenshot)] 

the account creation could fail for a myriad of reason, none of which can be 
predict befor try to creat the account. for exampl, the password might 
not conform to the system password polici. and differ nation version of 
window nt have differ rule about accent letter in password (betcha 
didn't know that!). it's better to tell the user about thi problem right awai 
so thei can correct their input rather than have a messag come up dure the 
long instal process later, forc the user to back up and fix it. and even if 
you forc the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did befor creat the account, otherwis you've left 
their system in an indetermin state. 

in ani case i need to write code to creat the account and delet the account 
in case someth later fail; i might as well call that code on thi page of 
the wizard where i can displai a us error messag. 

and what ar the kind of thing that need to be revers? well, in order to 
upgrad fogbugz without requir a reboot (and we _never, ever _requir a 
reboot), we have to shut down a coupl of process that might have been 
keep fogbugz file pin down, such as ii (microsoft's web server). so 
part on of the batch is "stop ii." now if part 2 fail for some reason, it 
would be _extrem_ rude to leav ii not run. and anywai, it's not like i 
don't need to write the code for "start ii" for the end of the batch. so the 
code to rollback "stop ii" is alreadi written. no big deal, i just need to 
call it at the right place. 

i think on reason that peopl think you should "gather all the info and then 
do all the work" is becaus with veri larg instal program that ar veri 
slow, thi is a polit wai to wast less of the user's time. inde even 
fogbugz setup doe 95% of it work at the veri end. but the "creat account" 
oper is so fast, that principl simpli doesn't appli here. even our 95% of 
the work phase take well under a minut, most of which is spent wait for 
ii to stop and start. 

*"why did you us vc++/mfc? sure an advanc intellig such as yourself 
ha admit by now that delphi[3] is more product."* first of all, leav 
your languag religi fanatic at the usenet door. somehow i manag 
to figur out_ in high school_ that languag advocaci and religi 
argument ar unbeliev bore.  

secondli, even if delphi were more product, the onli pertin question, 
sinc i am write the code, is _what is more product for joel spolski_. and 
i don't know delphi at all, but i know win32, mfc, and vc++ _realli, realli 
well_. so while i might not outcod a good delphi programm, i would 
definit outcod a complet inexperienc delphi programm (which is me), 
certainli over a short 4 week project. third, mani of the thing i need to do 
in thi setup program ar thing like "grant the logon as servic privileg to 
an account." thi is rare enough that the onli wai to find out how to do thi 
is to search the microsoft knowleg base and the web in gener. when you 
search the web in gener for how to do fanci thing with window nt, what you 
find is about 75% c code, mayb 20% vb code, and 5% everyth els. ye, i 
know, i could translat the c code into delphi (assum i wa a sophist 
delphi programm, not a complet inexperienc delphi programm), but that 
cost as much product as i would supposedli gain from your supposedli more 
product program languag. and fourth, i alreadi had about 30% of the 
code i need for setup in mfc format: from fogbugz 2.0 setup, and a librari 
i've been us for year to make wizard. 

*"why make setup at all? you alreadi have your custom' monei. good setup 
program don't increas sale."* thi wa actual the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. i came up with three reason: 

- decreas tech support cost. thi setup program will pai for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- delight my custom. when i'm try to get them to upgrad to 4.0, i want 
them to rememb how painless the 3.0 instal wa, so thei won't hesit 
becaus thei ar afraid to upgrad. i'm still us an old version of 
spamassassin that is becom increasingli ineffect, even though i know the 
new version is much better, becaus i just can't bear the thought of anoth 
morn wast. the veri memori of the first spamassassin instal -- all 
the littl ssh window, some su'ed, try to scroll through man page and 
googl group, accident hit ctrl+z in emac to undo and have it 
suspend, try to guess why we can't get the mta to run procmail, sorri it's 
too much. if spamassassin wa make monei off of upgrad thei would have 
lost my busi becaus thei don't have a setup program. 
- win review. softwar review alwai cast about for some kind of 
standard wai to rate softwar, even when thei ar compar appl and 
orang and planet and 17th centuri philosoph. thei alwai have a 
meaningless list of thing to review which can be appli to pc game, 
mainfram databas, web site auction softwar, and dna sequenc 
softwar. and setup is alwai on their list. a singl flaw in setup is 
guarante to be mention in everi review becaus everi review will see it 
and sai "aha!"


*"how can we make wise[4] better?" *kudo to the product manag of wise 
instal system for call me up and listen to my litani of all the 
reason hi product wasn't adequ for typic ii/asp/sql applic.
