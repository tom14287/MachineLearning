$ /sbin/modinfo ecb
filenam:       /lib/modul/2.6.32-4-amd64/kernel/crypto/ecb.ko
descript:    ecb block cipher algorithm
licens:        gpl
depend:       =20
vermag:       2.6.32-4-amd64 smp mod_unload modvers=20

(i us the full path becaus modinfo is in /sbin, which is usual not=20
in the user's $path).

but if you ar curiou onli about the hardwar relat modul lspci=20
will tell what modul ar us by the respect hardwar. you will=20
need to run it as root with the -vvv paramet.
