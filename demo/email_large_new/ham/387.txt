re: snow leopard refresh problemsy, i fix those issu with some silli workaround onli. the repaint 
method ar not produc ani fruit result.

these ar the option i us:
1. in some case, resiz the frame solv the issu.
2. in few case, chang the locat of on of the compon present insid 
the frame and then reloc the same compon to it origin posit at 
the end of the method solv the problem.
3. in on case, remov the compon and ad the same compon to the 
frame solv the issu.

anoth typic point to note is, i could not find a singl common solut 
for all the abov 3 case.

regard,
