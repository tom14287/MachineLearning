it's avail in sid:

http://packag.debian.org/sid/ipwatchd-gnotifi

but, ar you sure you want such a solut for your xen dom? :-? 

that tool seem to be focus for desktop user and just for alert 
purpos, i mean, what is intend to do when it detect a ip conflict?

you can us a network scanner (nmap, arp-scan, netdiscov...) to prevent 
assign a duplic ip address to the host but i'm not sure thi is 
your goal.
