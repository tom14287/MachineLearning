audibl bell in metacityhello list,

i like my audibl bell veri much. i realli realli like it =e2=80=93
unfortun, metac (from current test) block it in the
follow wai:

* "beep" work fine
* "xkbbell -forc" work, but it doesn't w/o the "-forc"
* gnome-termin and all the other applic can onli bell
  "visibl", i. e. i get a flash when enabl the visibl bell in
  metac's gconf-prefer but no audibl bell if i disabl it
  (and leav "audibl bell" enabl).
* the modul pcspkr is compil into the kernel and work fine, as
  proven abov.
* the volum of the "bell"-output is at 50% in alsamix, and as
  proven abov, ok thi wai.

i assum thi is the same bug as describ in
http://bug.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+sourc/metac/+bug/486154/

and comment 50 seem to provid a solut i didn't test yet =e2=80=93 my
question is, wether or not there is a debian-wai to enabl the bell
in metac or if i have to switch window manag as piotr engelk
did here: http://bug.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=3d551590

the hint he gave in thi bug report unfortun don't work for me
=e2=80=93 i enabl the correspond kei, but still can't hear a bell,
probabl becaus i don't us esd (is there ani reason why i should
instal thi? alsa work just fine for me=e2=80=a6)

best regard,

claudiu
