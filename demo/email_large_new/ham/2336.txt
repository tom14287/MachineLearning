re: [satalk] microsoft develop newslett tag as spamthi msdn mail thing remind me of how i've document thi featur of
spamassassin here so that our user understand it.

i defin "solicit commerci email" vs "unsolicit commerci email" -
the latter be spam. as spamassassin basic look for "commerci
email", both get hit, and that's someth thei must understand.

our sa document further tell user to filter off their sce befor
appli a sa rule - get rid of 100% of the problem as the user know who
is send them sce.
