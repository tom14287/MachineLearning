hi,
i have sun virtualbox. it's easi to us and instal.
the guest os that i tri and work: debian, mepi, opensolari, 
opensus, solari 10, xp and some other linux distro. desktopbsd and 
freebsd work but can't get gui -that can be lack of my knowledg.

same with open virtualbox except i think that there is no usb support.

aqemu (qemu) easi to us and instal -desktopbsd work's with gui.

i think that all vm have file share, print depend on usb if you 
have usb printer.
