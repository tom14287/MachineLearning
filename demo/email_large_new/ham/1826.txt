[satalk] procmail helpi'm fairli confus here, with procmail. 
i know thi isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my question in 
privat email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.  

i've look for web-stuff to answer thi question but i can't find anyth 
specif on thi scenario.

here's the situat. 
i have a global /etc/procmailrc file. it work, and when i insert stuff into 
it for log (logfil=/root/procmail.log, verbos=yeah. logabstract=all) it 
show up where i expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log)  at the end of 
thi file, i us 
 :0fw
 | spamc
to call spamassassin.

also in it is a carboncopi recip (ye, i know, it's on of the evil we do 
for our corpor master)  (at the top) (to their credit, i am instruct 
that thei ar not interest in the actual content, but ar concern about 
futur lawsuit and their culpabl, so thei want a record made. discuss 
on thi point is immateri)
:0
  * ? test -d $archivedir/$datedir || mkdir -p --mode=750 $archivedir/$datedir
  { }
:0 c
 $saveat

i have sever user where i forward certain spam to /dev/null  . . .their 
procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) look like thi:
:0
  * ^from: .*spermfun.com
  /dev/null

now i've got a person who need a copi of her inbound email sent to anoth 
email address (outsid the compani), so i've got thi recip in her 
/home/$user/.procmailrc file:
:0 c
  !user@domain.tld

it almost look like procmail's not run a user's copi recip after a 
global copi recip, except that i can replac that user's on with 
:0 
 * ^subject: .*test
  procmail.holder
and get the same result.

the result, to put it succinctli, is "noth". no forward go out, no file 
ar made, if i try to log inform, no log ar set up. i've modifi the 
user/group and permiss to match known-work recip (the spermfun 
exampl abov) and still noth.  howev, i can redirect those other 
messag.  in other word- just thi user's procmailrc file is not work- 
other user have no problem.

ani suggest would be help :)
