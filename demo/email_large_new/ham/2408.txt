juan

thi is what i found too.  the iw add-on "tor button" configur 
locat at

 prefer/ proxi set

list 2 option:

(a) us the recommend proxi set for my version of firefox (and a 
checkbox is mark next to the onli sub-option "us polipo" by default) or
(b) us custom proxi set

hand on heart i could not sai when thi chang took place as i haven't 
been us iw + tor + privoxi for a while, so thi came as quit a 
surpris.  there wa a recent updat to tor though, iirc, so it mai well 
have been dure that.
