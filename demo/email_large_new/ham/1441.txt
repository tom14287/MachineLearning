**************************************************************************
some of the mailto link on our web site forward to me. when i repli to
someon who write to on of these alias, i prefer to keep the mail alia
as the from: address in my repli. for exampl, when someon send email to
coolapp@linuxcar.com to suggest a program for me to review [pardon the
blatant plug...], it forward to me. when i hit repli, the from: line in
the email will contain coolapp@linuxcar.com instead of my main address
bneeli@linuxcar.com. my .muttrc file accomplish thi with two line:

set altern = "kbeditor@linuxcar.com|coolapp@linuxcar.com"
set revers_name
