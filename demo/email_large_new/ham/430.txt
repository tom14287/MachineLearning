troubl with transfermodei'm develop a qt app on window, and am us a wsh javascript to =
control output from the applic. i have everyth work, except i =
want to make a track blend 50% with the background and it just doesn't =
seem to work. here is what i'm us:

qttargetmovi.qtcontrol.movi.track(3).top =3d =
qttargetmovi.qtcontrol.movi.height-qttargetmovi.qtcontrol.movi.track(=
3).height;
qttargetmovi.qtcontrol.movi.track(3).transfermod =3d =
qttransfermodesenum.qttransfermodeblend;
qttargetmovi.qtcontrol.movi.track(3).operationcolor =3d =
"32768,32768,32768";
qttargetmovi.qtcontrol.movi.track(3).highqualitymod =3d true;

the first line is chang the locat of the track, which it doe just =
fine, so i know i have the right track address. the next line just =
doesn't seem to happen. the track is alwai set to dither when i check =
the movi properti. i am us version 7.6.6 of qt on window.

qttargetmovi.qtcontrol.movi.track(3).transfermod =3d =
qttransfermodesenum.qttransfermodestraighalphablend;
