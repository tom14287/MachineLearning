ye, i am sure of that.
i print all the step on the output to check:

# creat stream=20
## schedul stream=20
### start stream=20
[stuff happen]
#### stop stream=20
##### invalid stream=20
###### releas stream=20
# creat stream=20
## schedul stream=20
### start stream=20
[...]
#### stop stream=20
##### invalid stream=20
###### releas stream=20

i don't unschedul the stream from the run loop sinc i invalid it.

>=20


all the stream relat stuff is happen on the same thread (at least for =
now).
plu, in my exampl, i don't creat a new stream after delet the first o=
ne (sinc i have noth left to watch).

it seem to me the stream mai not be properli close, or it is try to ac=
cess someth that doesn't exist anymor.
but i am follow all the step for properli stop and releas the st=
ream.
