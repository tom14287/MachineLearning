=46irst it imho.

second it from what i understood about the differ purpos of debian-
kde and qt-kde-ml mail list.

and debian-kde is clearli sort as user mail list:

debian in kde
http://list.debian.org/user.html

debian-qt-kde: packag us qt and/or kde
http://list.debian.org/devel.html

so i think my view is not that far off.

so or so: your post did not seem to me to bring anyon even the slightest=
=20
bit forward toward have kde 3.5.

so i finish with a suggest, how thi can work:

=2d--------------------------------------------------------------------
hi develop and user of debian in kde,

i set up an alioth project repositori of kde 3.5 packag that i forward-
port to squeez at:

http://some-alioth-url

right now i start just with the forward port of the basic kde packag.

i like to continu that work and to make the packag co-instal with=20
kde 4.=20

i appreci ani help hand. if you ar a user and want to us kde 3 i=20
encourag you to try mai packag. pleas note thei ar not co-instal=20
with kde 4 in the moment. if you ar a develop pleas help me with=20

thank.

note: kde 3.5 doesn't realli need to be co-instal for those onli=20
interest in kde 3.5. at least not initi.

just a small start might pull thi off for you. but if you do not *act*,=20
probabl noth will happen. you can't chang those who ar not=20
interest in provid kde 3.5 for debian squeez. so either you start=20
pull it off for yourself or it - unless someon els feel the=20
motiv to do it - *will just not happen*.

it as easi as that.

ciao,
