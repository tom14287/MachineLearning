almost all nic load firmwar blob.  it's in dmesg somewher.  when the
firmwar doesn't load you get someth like thi in dmesg:

eth1: rtl8168d/8111d at 0xffffc90000c4e000,xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, xid 083000c0
irq 32
eth1: unabl to appli firmwar patch

that's a past from on of the op here who wa bitten by the 2.6.32-trunk
upgrad which iirc is the on that rip out the rtl firmwar blob.

i can't find via googl a dmesg snippet of a success rtl firmwar load.
here's what it look like for intel 8255x us the e100 driver, with the
firmwar blob all compil into the kernel:

e100 0000:00:0d.0: firmwar: us built-in firmwar e100/d101m_ucod.bin

"built-in" signifi that the firmwar blob ha been includ in the kernel
at compil time.  i do thi to avoid issu such as thi rtl problem.  it
onli add a coupl hundr k to the kernel imag.  and i us the vanilla
kernel.org sourc to avoid ani debian "non-free" issu.

just about everi nic on the planet us a firmwar blob.  there ar, iirc, 3
wai to load the devic firmwar into the linux kernel.  thi appli to all
devic that requir soft firmwar, not just nic:

1.  compil all devic firmwar blob into the kernel
2.  compil the individu blob into the driver, us initrd
3.  put firmwar file in root filesystem, tell kernel the path

#3 won't work with driver that ar need dure the boot process such as
block devic driver.  those requir method 1 or 2.  nic should be abl to
us 1-3.

there ar 3 differ dmesg statement and 3 differ error depend on
which method 1-3 abov that you're us.

yeah, i just pull the mail.  on upgrad to 2.6.32-trunk on hi
firewal, brick it until he disabl the onboard rtl and instal an
intel e100 iirc.  thei thought it wa a udev issu til i notic the
firmwar load failur messag referenc up abov in thi email.  the other
had an rtl wireless that fail for the same reason.  i can't recal how
thei fix that on.  iirc the op didn't swap hardwar to achiev the fix,
so thei did someth with the kernel/driver/firmwar.

do some ftp or scp test back and forth to anoth lan machin and see what
transfer rate you get out of that rtl chip.  i bet you get 1/3rd wire
speed at best, about 30mb/s, if even that.  the machin themselv need to
be modern to satur the link--no slow cpu or disk.  ani ~2ghz cpu with
512mb ram and a decent 7.2k rpm sata disk should be abl to push/pull 50mb/s
across the wire.  for that matter, elimin the disk by creat a 200mb
ram disk on each machin.  creat a test file with dd and ftp/scp it back
and forth between the ram disk.  if your rtl chip can peak the wire it'll
be a 2-3 second transfer if your network chip and linux tcp stack ar up
to the task.

> mayb if i ever get .32 or .33 i'll squeal in anger.  until then...

it's look like the rtl firmwar blob issu mai have been limit to the
trunk kernel.  you mai get lucki.  then again, if you roll your own and put
the firmwar blob in the kernel itself as i do, you shouldn't have a
problem.  that is, if the debian kernel sourc doesn't have the blob rip
out for be "non-free".

you mention you had problem build 2.6.32 and .33 kernel sourc.  do
you us the debian kernel sourc or kernel.org sourc?  i've been us the
kernel.org sourc for quit some time and have never had ani real problem
with it (knock on wood).  i had a build problem with .33 a while back but
that turn out to be due to a slight bit too much overclock on my machin
in thi warmer weather.  ;)
