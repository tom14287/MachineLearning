if i understand correctli, you cannot find execut.
i encount similar on my bsd box, when file chang
the name to firefox3. after a bit of climb up and
fall down, the answer ha shown.
if the question is: what is an altern to firefox,
i could sai: conkeror. depend on libxul. almost the
same look and feel, but no tabl nor bar. i recompil
from the sourc both lib and the browser. i assum for
debian alreadi mai be found the binari file.
if i miss the point, sorri.
