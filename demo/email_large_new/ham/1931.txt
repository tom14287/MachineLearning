it's possibl, but i would gener do it for clariti.  i like us the=20
type of variabl/argument as document, so i would store ani data wh=
er=20
the real type wa unknown in the union.  then access it though a "struct=20
cm_label *" or "struct volum_label *" on i had determin the correct ty=
pe.

sinc c union ar not tag, a c union is the same size as it's largest=20
member.  (nb: not realli sure how __attribut__((__pack__)) chang thing=
s,=20
if at all; it's possibl you need it on the union to prevent pad from=20
be ad after the space occupi by the largest member.)

initi option, but recommend.

sinc you ar declar a pointer to a structur, and not declar an obj=
ct=20
with type "struct cm_label", no space will be alloc for a cm_label.

make your declar a definit and that'll be handl.  (declar a=
nd=20
definit look veri similar for non-function type; the code given abov =
is=20
actual a definit if it is not within a struct/union type.)

struct volum_label vl;
struct cm_label *cm_ptr;

/* load data into vl */
/* determin that the data is actual a cm_label */
cm_ptr =3d (void *) &vl;

or, in your specif case, you should be abl to do someth like:

struct cm_label *cm_ptr =3d (void *) disk_specif->anchor->vlabel;

sinc you ar alreadi deal with a "struct volum_label *", there's no ne=
ed=20
for the address-of oper (&).

cm_ptr->label_id; /* or ani other member. */

exampl abov good?  pleas let me know if i can provid further assistanc=
