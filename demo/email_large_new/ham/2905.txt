thi sprung out of a report link by cindi about the promiscu of
femal monkei with male other than the alpha male, i.e, specif
not the tail end of the distribut.  "by mate with as mani
extra-group male as possibl, femal langur ensur [etc.]"

thi ha never happen.  it relev is nil.

so i chose not to type "on averag" explicitli in my post, sinc thi
is fork and on tend to assum that peopl have a clue.
