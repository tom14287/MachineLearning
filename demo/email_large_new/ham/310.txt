i work on a testhar for (wait for it) petrol pump some year ago,
littl embed control spoke to it do (not exactli the easiest
environ to track crash bug under) master which log it
piteou whine. i inherit the do part of it and work mostli on
creat the other end of it. near the end of the project we gave it
extens long burnin test, sadli overnight test would alwai crash
out for some obscur reason.  track it down show that my
predecessor's "add new entri to the end of it link list" function
recurs call itself with each follow link until the termin
on show up. of cours it di miser when it ran out of stack. i'm
sure he felt he'd done a good dai work when he plant that bomb for
me.
