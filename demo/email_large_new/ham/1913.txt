i've us dd to push a copi of a work system onto larger drive in the
past. so my misus of the term "migrat" is me actual do a copi of the
work system to a new, larger devic and then zap the origin.

i'd hope there wa a block by block wai to do it so i didn't have to set
up the partit & filesystem ahead of time but i suppos that part won't
be too pain.

the system is rel idl dure these type of surgeri becaus i
boot from a live cd so the data on disk isn't churn.

thank to all who respond, it gave me a lot to consid for thi type of
project. like do proper diff afterward to make sure everyth land
on the new devic properli!
