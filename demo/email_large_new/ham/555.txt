nor is there a ture test, even for someon with whom you've spent 11
year, boom, bust and boom again, and 3 children (trust me) there is
no magic litmu test other than the total empir: "try it and
see"

 and matter of the heart,
 peopl laugh at /anyth/
 and thing just fall apart."
 - michael leunig

the onli real test, the onli /sensibl/ test, is to look back and
realiz your relationship ha last 50 year and see no reason to
believ it couldn't last anoth 50.  in the absens of 50 year of
actual (ahem) hand-on experienti data, a photo and a few word ar
as good as ani, provid you ar prepar for the dynam of it.

love is a verb.  sex is a /share/ pursuit.  there is no
'relat-ship', there is onli the crew.  sail awai!
