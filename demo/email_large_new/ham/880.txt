first of all, forgiv me for cross-post, which is gener a no-no.
but if you can cross-post, i can cross-repli.

second, unless you repli to debian-user, to which i am subscrib, pleas
cc me.  i am not subscrib to ani of the other list.

i am not a debian packag maintain or a debian develop.  i am just an
ordinari system administr.  so i'm sure that my opinion will not count
for much.  but i am oppos to the remov of lilo.  both grub-legaci and
grub-pc us sector on the hard disk outsid of the master boot record
(cylind 0, head 0, sector 1).  in other word thei us cylind 0, head 0,
sector 2 and possibl subsequ sector on cylind 0 head 0.  thi break
the design of the backup softwar that my employ us.  thi backup softwar
back up the master boot record and all partit; but sinc the extra
sector us by grub-legaci and grub-pc ar outsid the master boot record
and ar not part of ani partit, thei don't get back up.  consequ,
if we have a hard drive failur and restor from a backup, we have an
unboot machin.  lilo us onli the master boot record.  a lilo-boot
machin can be back up and restor with our exist backup softwar
just fine.  given these requir, i wouldn't us grub-pc even if it
were bug free and well document.  (but neither is the case!)

as for the claim that kernel ar too big now, i find that hard to
believ, especi now that we have the larg-memori option avail.
the standard stock debian kernel imag file that i us for squeez,
vmlinuz-2.6.32-3-686, is current 2234080 byte.  ar you try to tell
me that there's no room for a 2m kernel below the start of the ebda?

i am abl to load *both* the kernel *and* the initi ram filesystem
below the ebda (i.e. the larg-memori option is not us) if i us
modul=dep instead of modul=most in the initi ram filesystem
under lenni.  i'll bet i can do it with squeez too.

i realiz that lilo doesn't work for everyon, and i'm not suggest
that it be the default bootload; but to get rid of it entir is
unaccept.  as far as i know, it's the onli bootload that meet
all of my requir, and i will not voluntarili give it up.

no doubt you will tell me that i am welcom to maintain it myself.
unfortun, i do not have the requisit skill to do so.  all i
can do is to appeal in the name of reason that it not be drop.

also, pleas excus my ignor, but what exactli is thi
"payload size" to which you refer?  is that the same thing as the
size of the kernel?  or is it someth els?
