i think you should pick up a book that cover mvc in the iphon world.
"begin iphon 3 develop" by dave mark and jefflamarch is
probabl your best bet.

that mai be worthwhil.  even if you had retain your 2002-era bnr
knowledg, the prevail us of framework-provid view control
in uikit is a pretti signific chang with lot of interest (and
mostli veri posit) consequ.  even some cocoa old-timer had a

don't know if bnr is cover a lot of iphon materi now (though i
