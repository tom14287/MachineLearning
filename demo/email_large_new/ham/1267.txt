re: cd player ui for toddler
our preschool (2 and 4) us winamp with a pokemon skin.  it's the
2-yr-old who figur out he could put it into a sidebar menu so all
he need do is click there to launch their favourit mp3 playlist.

what /we/ need is a good "bare liter" email program.  year ago
the univers of hawaii had a word processor that includ a
voic-assist and also would pop up menu for common complet as
word were type; even further back there wa a do sharewar editor
that did that latter function extrem well (target at the
handicap).  with just those littl bit of assist, mayb some
clever us of pictogram too, i bet kindergarten kid could handl
email.
