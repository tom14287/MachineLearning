re: [satalk] paulgraham.com articley, it is veri impress.  howev, all of the most advanc content
filter known to man is easili defeat by simpli present the content
in the form of a graphic imag (gif, jpg, etc.).  i'm surpris that more
spammer don't alreadi do thi.  i know we have discuss thi befor, and
mayb we can detect thi type of spam via the header and with razor/dcc (if
you're us them).  but that sure narrow down the ruleset (mayb that's
good).

quit interest -- it's pretti similar to the spam phrase stuff.  as
scott point out, thi would work quit well as a naiv bayesian system.
(in fact, i think it mai be quit close to be on alreadi...)

i like the wai "fl" -- ie. florida -- is on of the top score term. ;)

also, when i wa do the spam-phrase stuff, i discount the ff0000
thing, as html garbag! never realis it correspond to "bright red" :(
have we got a test for that?
