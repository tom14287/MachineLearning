i respectfulli disagre that a user group can be truli "for profit".
as i state, a for profit organ is out there to make monei.
that's it's goal.  user group ar design to bring peopl togeth.
when look at "what's good for the member" and "what make monei",
a for profit ventur would decid on monei.  while i'm sure it
wouldn't do someth "bad" to it's member, ultim by it's
definit it ha to make a profit.  noth wrong with for profit
ventur, but to have someon volunt in a for profit ventur isn't
realli volunt.  it's give of your time to make someon els
monei.

i think the fcp group ar great, but ar in a differ leagu on
everi level than appl user group.  thei have more in common with
macworld and wwdc , imho

i think, respectfulli that's an excus.  when group still debat
whether to support classic user, then it's gone from gradual chang
to extinct.

enlighten me.  i simpli can't imagin a scenario where the ancient
disc of the month and print newslett make sens.  i know the
argument:  "our member want print newslett",  "thei ar on
dialup and need these disc".  is that lead?  appl isn't target
peopl that don't have broadband internet connect.  thei don't
even make phone modem anymor.  those were discontinu.  these
aren't custom appl want to support or attract.  thei want these
custom to enter the 21st centuri.

oh ye thei do.  i'm a sharehold and get to vote on nomine.  i
alwai vote to remov bill campbel.  intuit treat the mac like a
second class citizen.  topic for a differ dai.  as a sharehold i
also get to go to the annual meet, start sharehold initi
etc.  it's much more democrat than the wai user group ar run.
