as you do not explicitli request the font to be us, i expect latex 
to choos some other font instead. doe it work if you run the command 
updat-updmap and try again?

otherwis, i have two suggest:

1) send and email to the debian-tex mail list 
(). that list is the offici 
maintain address for texliv-base, accord to 
().

2) report the problem as a bug. ().

befor do ani of those two, you should rewrit the exampl document 
to be as small and simpl as possibl (still show the problem) and 
perhap also translat the text to english.
