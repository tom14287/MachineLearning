penguin himself, kernel.org, ha run on xf sinc 2008.  sorri for the bodi
slam.  is your back ok mark? ;)  pretti sure i just "won" thi discuss.
err, actual, xf win. ;)  btw, the main debian mirror in the u.s. is
actual hous in kernel.org last i check.  thu, the file on your
system were veri like origin serv from xf.

 the linux kernel archiv

"a bit more than a year ago (as of octob 2008) kernel.org, in an ever
increas need to squeez more perform out of it's machin, made the
leap of migrat the primari mirror machin (mirror.kernel.org) to xf.
we site a number of reason includ fscking 5.5t of disk is long and
pain, we were hit variou cach issu, and we were seek better
perform out of our file system."

"after initi test look posit we made the jump, and have been quit
happi with the result. with an instant increas in perform and
throughput, as well as the worst xf_check we've ever seen take 10
minut, we were quit happi. subsequ we've move all primari mirror
file-system to xf, includ www.kernel.org , and mirror.kernel.org. with
an averag constant movement of about 400mbp around the world, and with
peak into the 3.1gbp rang serv thousand of user simultan it's
been a file system that ha taken the brunt we can throw at it and held up
spectacularli."
