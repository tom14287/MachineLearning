re: minor whoop with glimps supportther ar some case like thi with "incomplet ftoc".  these ar sure old
bug that appear after i ad the abil to onli scan the tail of the ftoc
if for some reason the scan modul decid it cannot easili merg the newli
scan (scan unseen) into the tail of the cach scan list.  hmm - i poke
around a bit. glimps.tcl us msg_chang, which ha code in it to try and
deal with show a messag that isn't in the ftoc:
        exmh_statu "cannot find msg $msgid - rescan?"
is that messag hide in your log?  perhap there should be a return from
msg_chang that glimps.tcl can us to decid what to do next.
