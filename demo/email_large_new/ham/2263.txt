um.. http://www.sun.com/softwar/star/gnome/ integr into solari.

of cours then there's http://www.sun.com/softwar/solari/freewar/ for 
solari 9 which give you afterstep and windowmak among other stuff. my 
person favourit at the moment is enlighten which also ha solari 
packag avail for download.

out of curios, doe `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the 
interact customis or is it like solari jumpstart where you can 
specifi everyth on the instal server, do `boot net - instal` go home, and 
come in to a fulli instal and patch desktop the next morn?

i don't see why thi should be a _major problem. the prom (ie the "ok" prompt) 
is almost at the hardwar level and henc dosent depend on the os so you 
should be abl to connect to that easili enough. onc the machin is instal 
cant you just log in over the network? the network is the comput after all 
(sorri couldn't resist!)

hmm... i'm not familiar with wyse stuff, but i onli need to us the consol 
when someth break, then anyth capabl of someth basic like vt100 at 
9600 8n1 seem to work  . not sure why you'd need to worri about thi much 
realli, just set up jumpstart to instal automat then you don't need to 
look at the consol at all.

cheer,
