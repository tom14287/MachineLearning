hello,

i've been us linux (debian) for about a year now, and although i'm no
longer scare of the command line i would like to do a littl
read/studi of linux to get a better understand of some of the more
advanc topic, or to see if i have learn a lot of the thing that might
be taught in a univers-linux/unix cours. i'm sure that there is a lot of
stuff that i've miss by just go at it with trial and error. perhap
there ar some onlin cours post to youtub, or a few book that someon
might like to recommend? i would be interest to know what type of thing
on must learn to get "linux-certif" (i presum there is such a
thing).

regard,
jame
