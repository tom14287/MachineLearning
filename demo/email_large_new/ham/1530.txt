yesterdai ar includ) - i eventu manag to contact the cv
server.

ps: i have the sequenc window vertic instead of horizont, and the
"colour from the ftoc" stuff all delet, and it is look just about as
good as the old unseen window us to look.   i still have some work to
do to make it a littl nicer (listbox seem to have some strang habit)
and then i need to make it all option and parameter, at the minut
i'm just embed stuff in the code, much quicker for prototyp.  onc
it done, i'll send a patch for someon to look over.
