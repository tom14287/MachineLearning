java web start offlin problemsin recent java version, there is a regress that prevent java web =
start applic from launch if there is no internet connect, =
even if thei have  attribut.  launch without an =
internet connect caus the applic to "hang".  thi is a seriou =
problem for us, sinc mani of our user move between have an internet =
connect and not have an internet connect - we have lot of =
unhappi custom.

i believ that at least part of the problem is thi oracl bug: =
 which =
claim will be fix in 1.6.0_20.  (there also seem to be other bug =
becaus launch without an internet connect still take wai too =
long even with the develop preview of 1.6.0_20 on window7 - but at =
least it doe launch.)

ha anyon figur out a workaround for thi problem?  ani suggest?
