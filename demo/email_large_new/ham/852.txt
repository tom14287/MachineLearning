ye, you're confus.

a linux distribut (_ani_ linux distribut) contain lot and lot
of separ codebas.  some ar under the gnu gpl.  mani ar not.  ar
you clear on thi point, now?  thi is my second try.  on suspect that
you actual understand perfectli, but just don't like it.

you're further confus if you think the gnu gpl give you the right to
get cover softwar for free.  it doe not.  it provid that _if_
you've lawfulli receiv a copi of the cover binari version, you have
right to also receiv the match sourc code.

then, if you nonetheless want a suse box set's content, the onli wai
you can do that without copyright violat _and_ without have to pai
the purchas price is to get someon to _give_ (not "lend" or duplic) 
you hi copi.

ask him _what_?  if you're ask him to "lend" or duplic hi cd,
then you'll be rip off suse linux ag illeg.

don't like suse's product licens?  write your own distribut.  you
can even grab most of what you need _from suse_.  all you have to do is 
heed the licens term on the individu piec.

what, you think that's too much work?  then, try a differ
distribut.  clue:  _not_ on packag in a retail box set.  even rh
7.3 retail box set includ non-freeli redistribut applic on
the star offic 5.2 cd and the product applic cd, among
other.  (the core 3-cd set of the basic rh distribut, on the other
hand, contain onli softwar that mai be freeli redistribut, whether 
open sourc or not.)
