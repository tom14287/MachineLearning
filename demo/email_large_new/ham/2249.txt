re 1. your swap partit's uuid must be differ. check
"/etc/initramf-tool/". there is a "resum" file (in that dir or in a
subdir) that will have your swap partit's uuid.

re 2. what do you mean by "after chang the uuid of the new
partit"? after "dd...", did your run "tune2fs -u ..." on your root
partit (or the equival for xf, ...; i am assum that you have
just on partit)? if you didn't, your root partit still ha the
same uuid and updat-grub is pick it up correctli (in which case, i
have no idea idea how you ar boot up!).
