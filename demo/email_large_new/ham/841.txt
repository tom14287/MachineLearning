re: new sequenc windowwel, i've us the check-the-modifi-time cach trick for file in
mani place (not just exmh) so some part of me certainli think it
is effect.  howev, it occur to me that if we do checkpoint
state, then aren't we modifi the sequenc file for the current
folder on everi messag read?  perhap we look at the sequenc file
more than onc per messag view?  just idl specul - we can
stick in some time call to find out how expens thing ar.

someon ask about increas the time resolut in the exmh log.
we could make that condit on some support avail in 8.3 -
tcl ha had "clock second" (like gettimeofdai) and "clock click"
(high resolut timer) for some time.  but in 8.3 we've calibr
clock click valu to microsecond.  it is still onli us for
rel time, but each call to exmh_log could emit the microsecond
delta sinc the last log record.  of cours, we ar measur all
the overhead of take the log record, etc.  i'll try it out.
