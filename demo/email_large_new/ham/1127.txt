sound like you're solv the wrong problem.  if untrust stranger
ar relai spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that
you've serious botch your qmail config (like forget to creat
an rcpthost file or someth).

anywai, if you insist on us razor to resolv thi problem, i
would suggest toss qmail-scanner 
and spamassassin  into the mix as well.
the former provid the qmail-integr framework on which the latter
doe it work (includ razor-check invoc).

fair warn: it'll be far more resourc-intens than simpli deni
relai privileg to everyon except the folk you trust.  to find
out how to do that, go to  (which, incident,
should be your first stop for all thing qmail) and search for "qmail
newbi's guid to relai".
