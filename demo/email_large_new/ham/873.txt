hi tim,
it isn't a "version" of anyth except nextstep, with a mac hackjob.
it ha a bastardis, but function bsd -layer- which sit's atop mach and
us case insensit hf+ but it isn't realli a bsd.

(here's a neat trick, touch "makefil" and "makefil", notic the lack of
error messag but the absenc of "makefil", and don't bother format for
uf. the appl uf implement perform like a dog, wa frozen in 97,
implement badli and ha not been updat sinc. hf+ get's tweak everi
now and then, but enough scream ha them look at shove uf2 in there
somewher down the road. )

then there's the holdov next inher weird, such as multipl version
of common unix file, but none of them do anyth, and all chang you
would usual append to them have to go through netinfo manag.

all in all, i find it to be a function, if not overli quirki desktop
environ.

as for your initi question,
