re: [razor-user] ricochet question actual

formail did the trick. thank to those who answer. for the sake of
archiv, here's how to "patch" ricochet:


1. procmailrc (/tmp/pmrc):

ricochet=/usr/local/etc/ricochet
pmdir=/tmp
logfil=$pmdir/pmlog
verbos=ye
maildir=/tmp
logabstract=all

:0 f
| /usr/local/bin/ri2


2. /usr/local/bin/ri2 (to test):

#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/ricochet -dont_send >/tmp/rico.$$

3. formmail exec:

formail -ds procmail /tmp/pmrc  -----origin messag-----
