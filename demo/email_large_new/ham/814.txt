thank, florian.

unfortun, dpkg wa too broken, so i had to us ubuntu livecd (becaus  
i could not find dpkg at debian instal cd / rescu mode) to boot and do  
follow:

  1. mount -t ext2 /dev/sdax /media/root
  # ...and all relev partit (/usr, /var, ...) respect
  2. mount --bind /dev /media/root/dev
  # sinc dpkg wa complain about miss debian-exim group, i had to  
get rid of statoverrid:
  3. chroot /media/root
  4. dpkg-statoverrid --remov /etc/exim4/passwd.client
  # later i must not forget to restor /var/lib/dpkg/statoverrid from  
statoverrid-old
  5. exit && cd
  6. wget  
http://ftp.cz.debian.org/debian/pool/main/e/eglibc/libc-bin_2.10.2-6_amd64.deb
  7. wget  
http://ftp.cz.debian.org/debian/pool/main/e/eglibc/libc6_2.10.2-6_amd64.deb
  8. dpkg --root=/media/root -i libc-bin_2.10.2-6_amd64.deb
  9. dpkg --root=/media/root -i libc6_2.10.2-6_amd64.deb
10. reboot

after reboot and restor of statoverrid, i can continu with apt-get  
upgrad and apt-get dist-upgrad; dpkg seem to work.

thank again to you all!
