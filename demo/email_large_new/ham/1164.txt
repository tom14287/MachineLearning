we've taken op to task alreadi for thi, but i guess it bear repeat.

us multipl hw control, and at least 7-8 drive, i believ wa the 
consensu, given that sw raid 6 is a perform loser and lose a 
control dure a rebuild is a real ruin-your-week kind of moment.

but while some of us were skeptic about just how bad the perform 
of raid 5 or 6 realli is and want citat of refer, more of us 
just question the perceiv frugal.  with four drive, wouldn't a 
raid 10 be better us of resourc, sinc you can migrat to bigger 
setup later?  and there we were content to let it lie, until...

i have ceas to have an opinion on thi, have been taken to task, 
myself, about it.  i believ the discuss degener into a nit-picki 
banter over the gener suitabl of xf, but i mai be wrong about thi...

serious, ext4 is not suitabl if you anticip possibl boot 
problem, unless you ar experienc at these thing.  the same is true 
of xf.   if you *ar* experienc, then more power to you.  although, i 
would have assum a veri experienc person would have no need to ask 
the question.

someon point out what i have come to regard as the best solut, and 
that is to make /boot and / (root) and the usual suspect ext3 for 
safeti, and us ext4 or xf or even btrf for the data directori.

(unless op were talk strictli about the data drive to begin with, a 
possibl i admit i mai have overlook.)


have i summar adequ?
