i think that perhap there is some languag barrier.

your origin post indic that you want line 1, 2, 4 and no other outp=
ut. =20
"i want onli output the first, second, and fourth line"

your most recent post sai that is "the problem".  which i infer mean=20

could you mayb rephras the question, or at least be a bit more verbos?

=2e..

if you want the output to go to a file try someth like (sed -ne '1,2p;4p=
'=20
"$input" > "$output").

=2d-=20
