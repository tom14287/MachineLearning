sequenc grabber and movi sync - record start earlierhi everyon,

we ar struggl with an offset issu in try to sync a movi
plai in the background with the start of a sequenc grabber record.
 the end result of the captur alwai seem to be ahead of the actual
movi that is plai back.  we ar try to pipe the end result into
an audio echo cancel librari and thi offset is caus pain.

here is the issu.

- we us sgdataproc callback for the record and preview.
- we start by call sgstartrecord() for the preview.
- we then prerol() the movi and set up all the captur movi.
- we share the sg soundchannel clock with the movi, and the videochannel.
- after thi is all complet we call setmovier() to start the
movi.  and then log a time stamp from the clock for record.  thi
happen about 5 second after preview.
- we call addmediasampl() when the time stamp (adjust for scale)
pass into the proc ar greater than the time set for record.  we
adjust the audio buffer and sampl input so thi is cut at the right
time base on the time stamp.
- we ar us a usb audio mic and a usb video camera.
- we have good a/v sync (lip sync)
- when we compar the record track to the background track the
record echo start befor the echo in the movi.  thi is by about
0.1 second give or take.  on would expect the echo to happen after
not befor.

we have tri to manual offset the time stamp for start time.  but
thi then produc a/v sync (lip sync) issu.  i assum thi is
becaus our
video frame is get there faster than our audio frame.  as on would expect.

is there ani reason why these frame ar get drop in the
record?  doe anyon have ani idea to get these 2 in sync.

thx for your time,
matt
