so you don't like the depend to akonadi? too bad. as can be read on mani place, akonadi is 
there to stai. and as you mention in anoth post, the depend to akonadi ha been in place for 
a while now (korgan and kaddressbook sinc 4.2). so there's no wai in hell you're go to have 
(upstream) support for an akonadi-less pim.

or don't you like the akonadi depend to mysql-server? well, it's not the full mysqld packag 
anymor, but the depend is to mysql-server-core(-5.1) (see #548419).
sqlite ha been found inappropri sinc it lack proper transact support.
postgresql is appar capabl of provid the proper featur and tobia koenig ha made akonadi 
work with postgresql sinc the end of last year (http://toko-kde.blogspot.com/2009/12/akonadi-
and-postgresql.html). that patch wa commit to trunk at that time, but appar didn't make 
into sc 4.4 (?).
so if you want to us postgresql, your best bet would be to port/base that patch on 4.4.

yeah right, let's get a combin of 4.3 and 4.4 (and 4.2?) into stabl, that sure must be 
prefer. and good luck get ani upstream support for bug result from that.

as ana indic the freez won't wait for sc 4.5, so better make the best out of 4.4.
if you want the freez to wait for 4.5, better try to convinc the releas team. good luck.
