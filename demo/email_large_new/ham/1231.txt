i've been veri happi with xf for all file size and count, but my server
isn't heavi duti by ani mean.  it handl multipl 50-60mb mbox file with
eas as well as serv samaba share contain 5000+ file per dir.  given
that the larg mbox file becom fairli fragment over time due to constant
append, have an onlin file defragment, xf_fsr, is veri handi.  the
myth that certain filesystem don't fragment file and thu don't need a
defrag tool ar just that, myth.  i've run with mbox on both ext2 and xf,
and the larger mbox file alwai fragment over time regardless of
filesystem.  prior to my last xf_fsr run, i had 10 mbox file (a singl
user) that rang from 10-35 fragment each.  those in the 20-35 fragment
rang were 40-60mb file.  i don't have empir data to show how much thi
neg affect perform, but my mail client did seem a bit snappier
after defrag.

i've not plai with ani of these myself, but what i'm see on the variou
mail list suggest what ron state here.

for product server i'd go with xf everywher as long as your kernel
(and rescu disk kernel) ha xf built-in.  reliabl power (via up and/or
gener) is part of the definit of "product" server, so there's no
reason to shy awai from xf for ani partit or logic volum due to
power loss fear.

some recent fs benchi comparison with 2.6.34-rc3 on a big raid setup:

http://btrf.boxacl.net/repositori/raid/2010-04-14_2004/2.6.34-rc3/2.6.34-rc3.html

as alwai, no singl fs win across the board.  xf fall flat on it face
in the synthet mail server test, but doe veri well in all other.  given
it result in the mail test ar almost ident to ext4, and that ext4
no-barrier increas perform 7 fold, i'd sai some tweak of xf would
bring it perform back in line with the other.
