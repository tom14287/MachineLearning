late, a fairli larg % of the spam i've been get ha been come from
spam system that forg my own address as the "from" address... those spam
messag would get through ani whitelist i set up (especi sinc i email
stuff to myself all the time).  if whitelist becom more popular, i
imagin spammer will resort to do that for the major of their spam,
make whitelist less help.

plu, i'm still not sure how i feel about whitelist.  i don't think i'm so
special that peopl should need to fill out a special form just to send me
email.  i could see certain friend of mine get fairli annoi
(especi those with multipl email address...).
