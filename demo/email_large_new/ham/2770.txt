detect a close ssl connectioni've written my appl push notif client code in java (on my =
server). i open an ssl socket to appl with a client-side cert, and push =
a stream of byte.

if part of that stream is mal-form, as i understand it, appl close =
their end of the connect. also as i understand it, thi is made =
evid to a c client becaus the number of byte written to the socket =
is 0 (or less than wa intend).

howev, in java, i'm find no evid at all that appl ha stop =
accept push notif, except that i can see the last =
notif doesn't go through (i set up a test case with on good and =
on bad token. by chang the order, i can see it work or not work).

what do i need to do to detect thi condit in java? i tri check =
that the connect is still open and not half-open after each token, =
but it alwai look good.

tia,
rick
