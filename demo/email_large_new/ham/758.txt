re: [ilug] re: newbi questiony, the lasat speed basic suck-ass.com, it won't work coz it from eircon
who ar shite. 

i have two of em sit in my drawer of "might have a us some dai or
other"...

get yourself an el-cheapo isdn card, 50 yoyo's will usual suffic. i have
a trust load a crap hfc base on which ha been trod along nice for
yonk. get detect automag by pretti much ani distro, ha kernel
support for a million year or so. 

later,
cw

p.s.: you other modem ar probabl winmodem and ar a pain in ze ars.com,
thei will work with lot of poke but not worth the effort imho. just us
isdn and nat it.


-----------------
regard:
anoth problem i have is that i cannot instal my isdn, usb modem ( lasat
speed basic ), howev im pretti sure it not support by linux, but again
it is featur in the hardwar browser, without instal driver.

thank for your repli.... howev i still cant get it to detect the
extern usb modem. i also have an intern 56k fax modem, but i cannot get
that detect either ( mayb it becaus it wa design for window and is
not support ). im not go to bui a new modem ( i think 2 is more than
enough for 1 pc ).

it could well be my inexperi with linux that is make thi more
difficult, but whatev it is iv just about had enough!! ani last gasp idea
would be welcom

mani thank

mark
