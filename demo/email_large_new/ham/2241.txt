you can run into that sort of problem if your pattern to replac contain a=
ny=20
forward slash (/) in it.  if you need to such an expans, you probabl=
=20
want to do it in two pass, first do a / to \/ substitut on your=20
replac string, then insert them into your final express:

pata=3d`echo $1 | sed 's,/,\/,'`
patb=3d`echo $2 | sed 's,/,\/,'`
sed -e "s/pattern1/$pata/" -e "s/pattern2/$patb/" < input > output
