nope, hibern doe not work with the nvidia driver, but i didn't/couldn't test it with the 
nouveau driver, sinc i couldn't get a login screen to begin with and ctl+alt+f1 didn't respond 
either, so it wa unus for me.
had to do ctl+alt+sysrq+(reisub) and boot into singl user mode to get my system work again.

desktop effect seem to be disabl by default on laptop, so that's probabl not it.
