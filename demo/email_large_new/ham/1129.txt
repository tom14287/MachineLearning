how can i initi a qtmovi object with certain attribut us
 writabl data?hello all,

i'm try to creat an empti qtmovi object that i can add segment to, 
and then plai. thi is easi to do with someth like:

movi = [[qtmovi alloc] inittowritabledata:[nsmutabledata 
datawithcapac:1048576] error:&error;];

i can then us -insertsegmentofmovi to insert segment from other 
movi into thi on so i can plai it back. the problem is that i also 
need to set a certain attribut when creat the qtmovi object. in 
particular, i need to set the qtmovieratechangespreservepitchattribut 
attribut, so that i can alter playback speed dure playback without 
chang pitch. thi attribut cannot be written after the movi is 
initi.

so, i can creat the qtmovi object like thi:

movi = [[qtmovi alloc] initwithattribut:[nsdictionari 
dictionarywithobjectsandkei:[nsnumber numberwithbool:ye], 
qtmovieratechangespreservepitchattribut, nil] error:&error;];

unfortun, thi is not edit. i've tri set the 
qtmovieeditableattribut as well on creation, but it doe not help. i 
still get an except when i try to insert anyth into thi movi. i 
presum thi is becaus there is no writabl file or data refer 
associ with the qtmovi.

ani idea on how to solv thi?

thank veri much,
