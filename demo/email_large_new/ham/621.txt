[satalk] ot: dn mx record clarif pleas
thi mai be a littl off topic but thought peopl here would have a better
respons to thi elsewher.

i have setup two mx record (mail and bmail) for my mail server. the on i
gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).

bmail(10) i gave a 10 becaus i want all mail to go through thi server to
be scan for spam and virus and then relai to the mail(20) server for
deliveri.

as i understand it, dn a record ar us in a rotat fashion for load
balanc, but dn mx record ar us in order or proriti, mean the 10
befor the 20 and onli 20 if the 10 isn't avail.

but onli some of the mail is actual be scan which lead me to
believ that not all of the mail is actual hit that box and the 10
never goe down. why? have i got someth confus here?

thank,
v
