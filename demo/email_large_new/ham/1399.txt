[razor-user] can't call method "log" issu - solut
i see that robert s. wojciechowski jr. post about thi issu on 7/26,
but i don't see ani respons. i get that error when call razor-report
from a sendmail alia, but not from the command line as a differ user.
the wai i solv it wa to run 

razor-admin -creat

and

razor-admin -discov

with a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directori, which is
explicitli specifi in the arg to the alia pipe.

the manual page, which suggest that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be
load first, doe not also sai that razor-admin will then creat a
.razor directori in the user's home directori if it doe not exist
(although thi /is/ point out in the razor-agent(1) page. thi mai
lead to some minor confus if the user is try to set the discoveri
and other default for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) instal. the
workaround is as i sai abov, name, explicitli specifi the path to
razorhom on the command line, e.g.

razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -creat
razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discov

hth,
steve
