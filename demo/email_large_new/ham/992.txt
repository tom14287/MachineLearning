  if you pass "-t archiv", that mean that version from archiv ar
treat as the default packag version.  it also increas the pin
prioriti to 990.  aptitud's resolv tri particularli hard to instal
the default packag version, and it will tie-break us the prioriti
(you can configur both those behavior extens, but those ar the
default).  the stori is more extrem with the apt resolv: it won't
even consid anyth but the default version of a packag.

  see also apt_prefer(5), section "apt's default prioriti
assign"; "-t" is the same as set default-releas.
