re: all set for red hat linux 8.0i would appreci it if you could get gabber packag for red hat 8. i 
will be make a new releas soon, but even in the meantim, 0.8.7 
packag would be ok.

i know that in the beta, red hat wa us a modifi version of 
gnome-lib which is incompat with the latest gnomemm. if thi is 
still the case in 8, i can send you a patch which make gnomemm work 
again...
