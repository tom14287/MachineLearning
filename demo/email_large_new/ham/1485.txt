when i am read thi thread there ar alreadi two search suggest
that ar better than what i might have come up with. my post is to
find out where the set wa actual done. i would have thought it
could onli be in /etc or /home --- but wierd thing can happen. where
is it? how long did the search command take to run? and some idea of
the size of your work environ?

if the caus for that particular locat appear to be someth that
involv user volit, it could still be us to know what mistak
can be made. better than learn from on mistak is learn from
other experi. tia
