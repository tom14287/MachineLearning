ye.  mani, mani more time.  a filesystem that can't grow is beyond usel=
s=20
for me.  luckili btrf support grow and shrink and it can do both whi=
le=20
mount.  on-line shrink is a trick i couldn't get reiser3 to perform.

well, i will still have to have a "partit" for grub to emb stage 1.5 i=
f i=20
go with gpt.  howev, it won't contain file per se.  i like have as muc=
h=20
as possibl on lvm becaus it make it easier to migrat to new storag med=
ia=20
and retir the old media.
