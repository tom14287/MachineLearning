 thi is a pain. 

 the onli wai you can resolv thi, to my knowledg is to download the
origin libvorbi rpm and the new on. remov the old on, then do:

 rpm -uvh libvorbi-*

 rpm then assum that you want both version instal at the same time,
and doe so. why you can't do thi after you have on librari alreadi
instal is beyond me.
