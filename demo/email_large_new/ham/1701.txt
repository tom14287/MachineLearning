red hat 8.0 ship with the bytecod hinter enabl; i think 7.3 mai have 
as well.

the enabl chang to "ftoption.h" is made by red hat's srpm befor 
build.  take a look at "freetyp-2.1.1-enabl-ft2-bci.patch" from the 
srpm; it's pretti clear that thi doe exactli what need to be done.

so if your font look ugli, lack of bytecod hint is *not* the caus.
