in ani kind of contract, both part have to agre the term. no 
agreement, no contract.

all of us hold our "person opinion" and nobodi can forc ani user to 
sign ani contrat thei don't agre. but then the relat between two 
part stop there. as i don't know what ar all of your specif 
situat detail, i'm also unawar if thi kind of agreement is out of 
place or just fit well within your environ.

in open sourc world, it is not so uncommom to make peopl who want to 
particip in some aspect of sensit develop (i.e. fsf) to sign 
and agre with their term, regardless the ag of the develop (if thei 
ar young, thei parent have to agre). that is the onli wai to protect 
(free) the code.

"quit"? full, i'd sai :-)

but is you who seek for a "comerci" solut. onli proprietari tool 
(adob reader?) enforc the us of the kind of polici you ar look 
for.

insid open sourc world is a bit difficult to find program or tool 
that make what you ar look for, that is, prevent user to make 
their own :-)
