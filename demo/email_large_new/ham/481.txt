final finish up (most of) tramp, my rdf interfac for python. (if you don't 
us rdf or python you can probabl safe skip thi entri.)  

new in thi version: rdf librari abstract (becaus rdflib's organ 
current suck), write valu in addit to read, and unit test, all with 
that old tramp flavor you've come to know and love.  

_but wait,_ it also come with an entir page of explan/advertis[1] 
if you're not alreadi convinc.



    rdf/xml got you down? tire of have to go through contort to deal 
    with data? want to write python and be standard-compat at the same 
    time? need a modul to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slide? *
    tramp mai or mai not be the answer to these problem!*



enjoi, and get a free bonu prize if you can tell me[2] why it's call tramp.
