process run at nice 19!i still have not gotten to the root of thi veri annoi problem.

in the earliest kde4 version, stuff start up at the normal default nice of 
0 (prioriti 20). i had a renic script to get all those akonadi daemon nice 
out of the wai so kde4 would be usabl.

on version (4.2.*) had stuff start at 0, prioriti 40 (did not know there 
wa such an anim) but it plai nice.

after that, it seem, everyth of kde4's menu, desktop icon, anyth it 
spawn is be nice to 19. thi render kde4 unus. so my renic script 
set plasma-desktop, kmail and sever of the core util back to 0 so i 
can us it. but thi workaround is no answer.

i have no idea why thi is go on. ani idea?
