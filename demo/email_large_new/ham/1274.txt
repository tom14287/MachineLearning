curiou.  i chang the argument to ftoc_showsequ to drop the folder 
argument and instead have an option msgid argument.  somehow your version 
of scanfold is still try to pass $f.  you seem to have the latest 
ftoc.tcl (1.36), but not the latest scan.tcl (1.27).

i don't know how that happen, but try get your sourc tree complet 
up to date.
