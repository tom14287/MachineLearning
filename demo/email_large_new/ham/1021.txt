  just for the record, it actual *is* possibl to boot off a partit
that's in raid1, but you might have to us grub.  the reason it work
is becaus grub can read past the md-raid1 metadata without get
confus -- sinc the raid is not run when grub is look at the
disk, it onli see on of the two, but sinc thei're mirror, and
sinc grub doesn't *write* to the partit, everyth work.

  i have sever product system that do thi.

  it's a bit complic to set up, but gener, it goe
someth like:

  - instal a basic system onto on drive, with the correct
      size of partit (call thi /dev/sda1).
  - set up an "incomplet" raid1 arrai, with on devic and
      on miss, with the second drive -- thi is /dev/md0,
      consist of /dev/sdb1 and an empti slot.
  - configur /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf, and re-build your initramf
      so that it ha the md modul and know about the arrai.
  - mount /dev/md0 somewher and copi all the data off /dev/sda1 to it.
      it's veri import to get the *new* initramf onto the arrai.
  - instal grub in the bootload of the 2nd drive. (the instal
      alreadi did thi for the first on). thi actual isn't
      essenti, but you mai need it if/when /dev/sda fail.
  - boot on to the incomplet raid arrai -- root=/dev/md0.
  - add /dev/sda1 to the arrai, and sync.

  now you have a bootabl softwar raid-1 system.

  i'm not sai thi solv the op's problem, necessarili,
but it's perfectli possibl.  i've never tri it with lilo
or grub2, but i would think it would work.
