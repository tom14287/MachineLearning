the total collect ar 1100 messag.  i train with 1100/5
messag.

i tri the "anthoni" stuff, but it didn't make ani appreci
differ that i could see from stare at the fals neg rate.
the number ar big enough that a quick eyebal suffic.

then i tri a dirt simpl token for the header that token the
word in the header and emit like thi "%s: %s" % (hdr, word).
that work too well :-).  the receiv and date header help the
classifi discov that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.

so i tri a slightli more complex on that skip receiv, data,
and x-from_, which all contain timestamp.  i also skip the x-vm-
header that my mail reader ad:

class mytoken(token):

    skip = {'receiv': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }

    def token_header(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.item():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continu
            for w in subject_word_re.findal(v):
                for t in token_word(w):
                    yield "%s:%s" % (k, t)

thi did moder better.  the fals neg rate is 7-21% over the
test perform so far.  thi is versu 11-28% for the previou test
run that us the timtest header token.

it's interest to see that the best descrimin ar all ham
discrimin.  there's not a singl spam-indic in the list.
most of the discrimin ar header field.  on thing to note is
that the presenc of mailman-gener header is a strong non-spam
indic.  that match my intuit: i got an aw lot of
mailman-gener mail, and those list ar pretti good at surpress
spam.  the other thing is that i get a lot of ham from peopl who us
xemac.  that's probabl barri, guido, fred, and me :-).

on final note.  it look like mani of the fals posit ar from
peopl i've never met with question about shakespear.  thei often
start with stuff like:

> dear sir/madam,
> 
> mai i pleas take some of your preciou time to ask you to help me to find a
> solut to a problem that is worri me greatli. i am old scienc student

i guess that read a lot like spam :-(.
