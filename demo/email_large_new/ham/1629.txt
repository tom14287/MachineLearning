how hot it feel is affect by both temperatur and humid.  in 
mississippi thei have lot of humid, in the southwest, we don't.

as i know from experi, mississippi feel a lot hotter at 90 degre f. 
than home (santa fe) doe at 90.

perhap the militari didn't want to train in a real desert becaus 1) it 
get's over 100 degre and ani time the air temp is greater than bodi temp 
it affect perform, and 2) when those troop go to a real desert 
thei'll think it's so much nicer than mississippi.

no, i'm not malign mississippi.  i had a great time pass through last 
year on vacat.
