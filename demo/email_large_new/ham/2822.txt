i didn't sai it wouldn't work.  i said it is unsupport.  there's
a differ.  debian doe make modif to the kernel sourc.
the offici debian kernel sourc packag have been modifi by the
debian kernel team after download them from kernel.org.  there is
a reason for all of these modif.  often it's to prune "non-free"
driver from the kernel sourc tree.  but there mai be other modif
made for other reason.  the debian kernel team onli support their
own kernel sourc.  if you obtain kernel sourc code directli from
upstream, and you have problem run it, you will have to seek
support and file bug report directli with upstream kernel develop.
you can't file a bug report against the debian kernel sourc packag
becaus it's not the debian kernel sourc.  and you can't ask for
help from the debian kernel team on their list becaus it's not
their sourc.  thei will have noth to do with it.  that's what
i mean by unsupport.
