wrt the last, it's a small pile of window .ex file along with
cygwin1.dll.  the .ex ar cmdline program.  on is a pop3 proxi.  if i
current have an email server name, sai, mail.comcast.net, with user name
timmi, then i chang my email reader to sai that my server is 127.0.0.1, and
that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmi.  in that wai the
proxi pick up both the real server and user name from what the mail reader
tell it the user name is.

thi is an n-wai classifi (like ifil that wai), and "all it doe" is
insert a

    x-text-classif:  on_of_the_class_name_you_pick

header into your email befor pass it on to your mail reader.  the user
then presum fiddl their mail reader to look for such header and "do
someth about it" (and even outlook can handl *that* much ).

the user is respons for gener text file with appropri exampl
of each class of messag, and for run the cmdline tool to train the
classifi.
