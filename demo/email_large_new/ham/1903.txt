thi is so true.
when i look at establish appleus.org, as a central locat of  
resourc for australian user group, i thought long and hard about  
the name i wa go to call the group... and i deliber steer  
clear of us mac or macintosh in the name... as i wa awar that  
appl provid more than that product.

also appl themselv have never refer to user group as macintosh  
user group... the offici logo thei provid actual sai appl user  
group

mind you mug sound better as an acronym then aug doe :)

appl ha save itself... and as much as i believ user group did a  
far better job of keep the appl flag visibl back in the '90's  
then appl itself did, that is no longer the case in the 21st centuri

i agre that user group ar now basic fan club... or social  
group that ar bought togeth through a common interest of the  
devic and softwar that on compani produc.

but i disagre that a user group can't be a "for profit" enterpr...  
as there ar group out there that ar exactli that - look at some of  
the final cut pro group as a perfect exampl that work extrem  
well under a "for profit" arrang.

as other have mention, could you have chosen a better analog than  
hannah montana :)
but the point you ar make is quit correct.

i have friend who ar involv with local histor societi, model  
train (and even real on) appreci societi, and even reptil  
keeper who get togeth to discuss rais of snake, lizard etc...  
thei don't expect that on singl compani ow them anyth to help  
them exist or to function.  appl user group should look at how some  
other 'social', 'hobbi' and 'fan' club work.

everi group that i have seen take that attitud isn't around anymor,

whilst i strongli advis all user group that thei need to evolv,  
thei don't need to be reactionari with chang. evolut is a gradual  
chang.

and whilst everi group need new member to surviv, let alon expand,  
we have to rememb that market 101 theorem that it is often easier  
to retain an exist custom then it is to get a new on.

so don't suddenli alien your exist membership, but rather help  
lead them

appl's own 'think differ' market strategi is still in place at  
appl todai, even if you don't hear it been said... there is no other  
wai thei could have produc the iphon and ipad without embrac  
thi philosophi.

user group need to do the same

there ar still place for newslett and disc of the month, even in  
the 21st centuri... but again thei need to be thought about  
differ... and form part of an overal strategi of attract the  
same sort of custom that appl themselv now target.

then again, appl itself isn't exactli democrat in the wai it  
appoint it' own board. the board itself effect nomin itself  
and then sharehold ratifi those nomin.... usual for the  
board as a block and not for individu nomine.

and sharehold certainli don't get a sai in the dai to dai  
manag of the compani nor the project that appl work on and  
eventu bring to market or even kill off befor thei get to market!
