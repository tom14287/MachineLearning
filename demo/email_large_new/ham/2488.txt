on a more seriou note....  would unrm be nice?  yeah.  but peopl have
talk about unrm for nearli ***20*** year - and that's just what i
bother to look up.  think about it.  in that time bsd ha been freed
from at&t; and then fork in four differ direct, gcc, linux,
mozilla, gnome and kde have been written.  as ha almost everi bit
of the gnu project - includ (sh|file)-util.  and think about it,
have the gnu (sh|file)-util develop ever met an option thei didn't
implement if thei could?  even /bin/true and /bin/fals take argument.

so yeah, unrm would be nice, but obvious it's not a simpl problem.
million of line of code, hundr of project, no unrm.  heck, the
hurd will probabl releas 1.0 befor unrm show up.
