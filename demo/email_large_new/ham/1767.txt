i just us googl to search "grub2 btrf", and the result don't look
promis.  

not that you ask, but btrf is still in develop; i wouldn't think
that support it is anyon's top prioriti.  if you ar plan to
keep anyth import on thi system, i'd think twice about us
a filesystem that's still in flux:

http://btrf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/main_page

"btrf is under heavi develop, but everi effort is be made to
keep the filesystem stabl and fast. as of 2.6.31, we onli plan to
make forward compat disk format chang, and mani user have been
experi with btrf on their system with good result. pleas
email the btrf mail list if you have ani problem or question
while us btrf."
