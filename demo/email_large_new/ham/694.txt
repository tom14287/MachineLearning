ye an error occur.
/user/sam/crap2/desktop/memorizeasi/derbi.properti (no such file or
directori).

it's a correct error too. us the instal dialog i tri to make
folder ~/desktop/crap2, but mayb mess up (that dialog is horrid)
becaus it's actual creat a folder ~/crap2. which is empti, and note
thi isn't ~/crap2/desktop as in the error messag abov. so it's
look in the wrong place.

by the wai that instal dialog is realli horribl. :) especi that
you're just thrown into it. i hope you can remov the instal process.
you could make it into a .dmg-distribut .app-bundl for mac user
instead of webstart at all, which would be nice.

webstart can be ok too, but pleas make it realli be webstart, ie let
java manag where the program file ar store. either wai, there's no
need to make user select a folder for user data either - you can
automat store ani user data file somewher reason like
~/librari/applic support/yourapp on mac, the equival applic
data folder on window, and ~/.appnam on other platform.

either 'normal webstart' or '.app bundl in dmg' would give you an app
that requir no configur or instal process, make it much
easier/less scari for user to instal and try out your app. would
probabl also sidestep thi platform bug (?). :)

--sam

ps if it wasn't clear, i haven't instal the develop preview yet, so
still on 1.6.0_17... realli need to do that soon.
