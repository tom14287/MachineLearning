have recent check out both of these, for a select of
book, the exact same basket of book cost more in both .de and
.fr (take deliveri charg, vat et al into account) than bui
the same thing in amazon.co.uk

the book i us to check were 
1) c unleash (heathfield et al)
2) design pattern (gamma et al)
3) comput graphic, principl and practic (folei et al)

i wa huge surpris that amazon.co.uk work out cheapest - by
a consider margin, too - someth like 12 euro after
freight wa taken into account.

cheer,
dave.
