asterisk in debian/lenni without junghann.net support?hi!

asterisk in debian/lenni claim to be bristuf, not? at least the
the debian patch track system show the bristuff-patch:

[1] http://bit.ly/brrhe7

we have a quadbri-card and recent need support from junghann.net
but thei refus tell us there is no bristuff instal becaus of
the show version output:

*cli> show version
asterisk 1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenni1 built by pbuilder @ grnetbox on a  
x86_64 run linux on 2009-12-14 19:04:56 utc

why wa the "bristuf" line remov? debian/etch did have that
postfix.

after tell them debian/lenni is bristuf thei said thi
"instal method" is not support. huh?!
doe anyon ha a comment on thi?

greet,
