configur error us tor, privoxi & polipodear all

on an up-to-date test machin, i am us iceweasel + tor + privoxi.  
florian help me with an issu like thi sometim back, but revisit 
hi help advic ha not help on thi occas.

the situat is as follow:

us iceweasel, i enabl the tor button and receiv a warn messag 
"tor proxi test: local http proxi is unreach. is polipo run 
properli?"

well, no becaus polipo wasn't instal - why and when thi suddenli 
becam a necess i don't know, but anywai i instal polipo and 
configur it accord to the tutori on 
http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/polipo which, in my circumst, 
requir me to uncom thi line in the config file:

         socksparentproxi = localhost:9050

have restart the daemon, and still get the same error and no 
connect, i point the browser at privoxi as per the polipo 
configur page refer to abov, in the prefer/ network 
set tab, and in the polipo config file, i uncom the line:

         socksparentproxi = localhost:9050

i then restart polipo, doubl-check the privoxi config file to 
ensur that forward wa still set as requir and restart the tor 
and privoxi daemon.  howev, i still get the same error messag 
(basic cannot connect to web-page) and the tor test give the same 
result as befor.

 from research thi on the web, i am unabl to ascertain whether or 
not i even need polipo, but the prefer set tab for the tor 
button have a check-box for us polipo, so it appear as if tor is now 
expect polipo to be instal and run as default.  but, i have 
now reach the limit of what i know what to do or can figur out.  i am 
also consciou of the risk of screw thing up further in an effort to 
fix thi, so befor proceed further would like to ask thi list for 
help and advic.

i appreci ani thought/ idea.

thank

ag
