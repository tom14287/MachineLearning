note that mani debian kde 3.5 instal includ both qt3 and qt4,
e.g. to support kdebluetooth or lsb-desktop.

if you upgrad your ram from 1gb to 2gb, kde 4 feel about as fast
as kde 3.5, except kde 4 startup and kmail startup ar still slower.

on reason for need addit ram seem to be memori leak,
although whether in qt4 or kde itself i don't know.
