market can't find it bottom with both hand
-----------------------------------------------------------------
rememb when nasdaq 2500 seem imposs low? welcom back to 
cruel realiti. these dai, with few analyst will to call a
market bottom, financi report outdo each other with dire
assess of how bad thing ar and how much wors thei can
get. mayb morrissei should do a concert on wall street; the
self-piti can't get much wors.

the market' close number were the same in everi citi, but
you wouldn't know it from the headlin. it wa the dow's worst
monthli perform in four year, said msnbc. "3rd quarter
worst for stock sinc '87," read the denver post, repeat a
popular figur reach by talli the dow and s&p;'s percentag
loss. the new york daili new count percentag loss for
the month onli and declar it the worst septemb sinc 1937.
everyon predict a lousi septemb 2002, so the phrase
"self-fulfil propheci" doe spring to mind. 

so doe the phrase "gloom and doom." "everi dai for the last
three month, the market ha eras $73 of wealth, includ
saturdai, sundai and holidai, for everi person live in the
unit state," said the san jose mercuri new. "countless
investor ar start to wonder if stock will ever go up
again," wrote usa todai. in a more plausibl statement,
thestreet.com's aaron task said recent declin "demonstr
onc again the folli of investor' repeat attempt to pinpoint 
a bottom" and "disabus(d) them of the idea that the best time
to bui is when thing look worst, if onli becaus recent histori 
ha shown stock can go from terribl to aw and beyond." 

ok, breath. go read the comic or someth. feel better?
good, becaus there's more.

the new york post, in small enough word for everyon to
understand, made the public servic announc "bewar!
octob is a veri bad month for the stock market." and you
shouldn't take candi from stranger, either. the post's john
crudel, a market curmudgeon befor it wa in style, warn,
"thi market is veri danger, even if thing look like thei
couldn't get ani wors." detroit free press columnist susan
tompor agre that "the next round of statement could inde
look pretti nasti." 

we have to agre: the stock market is bad. the economi is bad.
it's go to get wors befor it get better, and that mai take 
a while. the "bottom" is, technic, zero. be cautiou, ye,
but don't let the media's bipolar disord ruin your dai. just
like dot-com weren't realli a new economi, a bear market isn't
the end of the world. - jen muehlbauer

winnick: hand-off or red-hand?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
former global cross chairman gari winnick will appear befor
a congression committe todai. it won't be pretti. cnn
predict he will plead the fifth. most other outlet expect
winnick to testifi.

impetu for all the coverag wa yesterdai's releas by the
hous energi and commerc committe of memo indic that
winnick wa in the thick of the compani's suspect dealmak. a
committe spokesman said, "if he tri to portrai himself as an
out-of-the-loop ceremoni chairman, we intend to remind him
that he is under oath."

the memo that got most of the attent wa on from then-ceo
leo hinderi to winnick in june 2001. hinderi warn in color
languag that the compani wa head for a fall. the financi
time, washington post, and new york time all ran a quot from
the memo compar telco to salmon. hinderi urg winnick to
unload the compani -- "without look like we ar shake our
booti all over the world," quot the two times -- and
resign shortli thereaft.

on littl detail from the memo is guarante to make winnick's 
time under the televis light even more uncomfort. among
the compani he us hi influenc with, to help close deal,
wa enron. all the report mention enron, but the new york
time seem to be alon in note that global cross never
complet a deal with the fallen energi giant.

the wall street journal look beyond the obvious embarrass 
detail of the memo to point out that, despit such evid,
the gun might not be smoke yet. "prosecutor would still need
to prove that he knew the transact were improp and us
them mainli as a wai of enrich himself by boost the
compani's stock price artifici," the journal report
wrote. the ap note that all of the memo were date after
winnick's last sale of global cross stock, $123 million in
mai 2001.

despit hi $734 million in stock profit, gari winnick wa not
among the five telco execut be su by new york attornei
gener eliot spitzer to return their ill-gotten gain. is
spitzer bet, with the journal, that winnick might walk awai
clean? - keith dawson
