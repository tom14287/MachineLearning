i instal 10m3050 and it look like overal a big improv.  in 
particlar, the render error i've seen ar gone.  howev, i have 
notic on new problem which i don't think wa present in the previou 
version of the plugin.  i can't (mous) drag insid an applet in firefox. 
drag work in safari.  if i open

http://pivot.apach.org/demo/decor.html

i can't move the "window" by drag the titl bar.  also, if i open

http://pivot.apach.org/demo/itun-search.html

and search for "beethoven" i cannot drag the scrollbar.  do you have the 
same problem?

cheer,

michael
