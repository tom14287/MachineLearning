netscap 7 reviewthi is my netscap 7.0 review.

o thei final got the email search speed back up to
   where it wa in 4.7.x
o set up user mail account doesn't have that realli
   odd, sometim it let me sometim it doesn't problem that
   previou version had.
o i still have to manual updat all my address book by
   hand but at least it let me import them as netscap 4.x
   address book (there's not 6.x import as thei just assum
   it work--which it doesn't)
o the mail filter ar still broken and have the same problem that
   i've tri to report sinc 4.0.2 where you can't store a mail
   filter of the type: ag in dai, is greater than, 21 (or some number)
   gawd i'd realli wish thei'd fix that freakin' bug, it's the singl
   biggest annoy that i have with netscap as it's on of the
   most effect anti-spam tool that i have.
o webex doesn't support netscap 7.0 and the plugin doesn't
   work which caus problem when you want to us webex to
   work on someth with someon remot.

i've given up try to report bug and ani chang to the
sourc i send alwai get lost.
