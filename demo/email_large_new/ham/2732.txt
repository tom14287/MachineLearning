actual the more i think about it, the more i realis that i would rather have 
some kind of full blood monitor app which let me see stat (or even chart 
like ntop) of internet speed over the week, although i bet that is just dream.

i read on thread somewher out there about app like cacti, zenoss and 
groundwork - if you know anyth about such packag, then you know more about 
them than me: is thi kind of packag remot suitabl or am i bark up the 
wrong tree?
