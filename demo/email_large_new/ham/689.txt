actual, the problem is that nobodi care enough about kde 3.5 to
actual do anyth about it.  ye, fine, there's triniti, but as far
as anybodi can tell, that's just on gui.  i'm sure you could find on
gui somewher out there still hack on linux 2.2 or someth equal
dead.  doesn't make it ani less dead.

ye, you can have kde 3.5!  you can even have it as an offici part of
debian!  nobodi will stop you!  howev,  you will need to do some work.
you will need to make sure that there is suffici upstream develop
committ to keep it usabl and current, and you will need to make
sure there is a suffici motiv packag team to keep up with
upstream work, triag bug, and cooridin packag updat with
upstream, the the releas team, the secur team, etc etc.  can you do
that?

noah
