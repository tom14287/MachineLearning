thi onli restat the assert, it doesn't clarifi /how/ govern
restrain you, other than under law of crimin conduct and violent
crime (if you meant the abov liter)

if i can trace a spammer to their isp, i can /gener/ get that
account revok, and if you trace on to their parent corpor, i
don't know of ani law that specif /exempt/ them from lawsuit,
it's just that no on ha yet succeed in ani import wai.  if you
have some law that prevent action against spammer, then why all the
class-action suit and other anti-spam court case, some even
state-fund?

i'm also curiou of the mechan of your retribut strategi: let's
sai you did win a lawsuit and shut down the largest spammer network in
the usa, do you realli believ 40 beij spammer won't fill the
void?  do you realli believ those 40 ar not right now prep their
mail server whether or not you prevail over your countrymen? how do
you intend to take legal (and/or violent) action against peopl a
world awai and in a cultur you can bare understand let alon
understand how to properli bribe?  

i'm not so hope thi method can work against aromatherapi viagra
when we can't even track and convict murder nigerian mafia, and
thei ar blatant!  polit solut is a contradict in term, and
it's also true that no lawmak ha ever been even a tenth the
catalyst on improv the qualiti of life in britain and the western
world as did central heat and the invent of on a.j.crapper.
