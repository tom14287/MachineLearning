movieaudioextractionfillbuff call exit?i'm run quicktim on window (xp sp3) and have a reproduc wai to
make movieaudioextractionfillbuff in a c++ program do someth strang.
it look like it's call exit() or do someth equival, but i can't
sai for sure.   what i do see is that immedi after call
movieaudioextractionfillbuff, execut continu in the destructor of my
static alloc object.  if i replac the call to
movieaudioextractionfillbuff with a call to exit(), i see the same thing.

i'm us version 7.3 of the quicktim sdk, but 

long version;
gestalt(gestaltquicktimevers,&version;);

popul version with 0x07668000.  i can reproduc the same behavior with
version 7.1 of the quicktim sdk, but gestalt still return the same thing
in thi case.

the quicktim-relat thing that happen befor thi ar:

- quicktim initi normal
- quicktim read metadata from on aac file
- quicktim read metadata from a second aac file
- quicktim read the audio properti of an mp3 file
- and then i call movieaudioextractionfillbuff

the audio-relat function call ar:

movieaudioextractionbegin
movieaudioextractiongetproperti(kqtpropertyclass_movieaudioextract_audio,
 
kqtmovieaudioextractionaudiopropertyid_audiostreambasicdescript);
movieaudioextractionsetproperti(kqtpropertyclass_movieaudioextract_audio,
 
kqtmovieaudioextractionaudiopropertyid_audiostreambasicdescript);

all of which work as expect (or at least i think thei do).

and then

movieaudioextractionfillbuff

i can give more detail about the api call if necessari.  i think i'm
call quicktim correctli sinc it decod audio successfulli almost all
the time -- with thi file and mani other (i.e.
movieaudioextractionfillbuff return normal).  i've had custom report
similar problem, but thi is the first time i've been abl to reproduc it
reliabl myself.  unfortun it's with a complex program.  my attempt to
reproduc thi with a simpler program have fail.  it seem to be
time-relat but i can't do better than that at the moment.

i'd love some help figur out what's happen in
movieaudioextractionfillbuff, and even better some help make it go awai.
if i need to report thi in some more offici wai to appl to make that
happen, pleas let me know.

thank much.
