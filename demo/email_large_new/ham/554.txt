re: storag bitsat fermi (ye i'm back there; long stori), we're bui 4u system like 
the fiscal year is end.  we have ~20 asa ir4us1 system (not push 
them, there ar some other similar unit avail), with 60 more on 
order.  thei're 2-1/2 tb for $10k, although we add a separ id or 
scsi system disk, becaus the 3ware raid control can satur. 
intel sd2 motherboard, 2 1.4ghz p3s, 2 gb ram, 2 3ware 7850 raid 
control, 16 160gb maxtor, syskonnect gigabit enet, fermi redhat 7.3.

there's some interest info at:

http://mit.fnal.gov/~msn/cdf/caf/server_evalu.html

we've decid to go with xf (which linu ha just merg into the 2.5 
tree), mostli becaus none of the other journal fs's can maintain >30 
gb/s rate with a nearli full filesystem (mostli gb file) with random 
delet (we us these system for cach our 2 petabyt tape store). 
  ext3 almost did it but drop from from ~38mb/s to 10 with random 
delet, and didn't want to do direct io at all.  onli concern is an 
occasion system lock-up we haven't chase down yet.  a load avg > 100 
is alwai a patio of fun.

oddli, even fairli beefi system like these will breath hard to keep up 
with the new stk 9940b tape drive, which crank along at a steadi 
30gb/s.  and you oldforktim will rememb "doofu" my old file server 
system.  it would onli take 2.1" of rackspac now, instead of 14 rack.

cheer,
wayn
