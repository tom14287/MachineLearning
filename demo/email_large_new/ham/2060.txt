hi camal=c3=b3n,

in english the slash is understood to mean "or".  there is no limit of
32000 file or folder under a folder in ext3.

there is a limit of 31998 directori under a directori.  thi is caus by
the ext3 hard link count limit be 32000.  two link ar need for the
parent directori entri and the current directori's ".", leav onli
31998 link avail for ".." link from subdirectori.

thi limit is rare encount in practic becaus it is so much more
effici to us multipl directori level, e.g.:

parent-
  a-
    abl
    alf
  b-
    beta
