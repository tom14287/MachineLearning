shoe horn kde3.5 systemhi 
it sound a bit weird but it pretti close to what i need to do.
as you can see from my footer i us mandriva and i like it.
i have howev an app which doe not.
it need qt3 and kde3.5 to run, anfd it ha to be run in a kde dm. it crash
when run on gnome.i have made space in the middl of on of the two sata drive.
there's about 100 gb it can us.
i have gone back on mandriva releas and 2008.0 wa the last to sole us
kde3.5, if piklab find a kde4 lib it crash, and from mdv2008.1 thei merg.
mdv 2008.0 would be ok but it won't recognis sata hd.
i tri ubuntu to try and load it in that 100 gb gap, but it want all of the
drive, even when told us unus space.
i know debian is stabl, will the instal if told instal it self on to an
unus section of the sata hd and put it bootload at the start of the rott
partit , ie" /", not /root.
is the a version that us kde3.5, qt3 that will work on a sata hd, will the 32
bit version run on a 64 bit or must i us the amd_64 version.
ar the ani problem with the kernel suppli with what ever version is
suggest with rtl8111/8168b pci express ethernet card, on mdv certain kernel
in 2009 had problem with the driver for that card.

a quick repli would realli be appreci, i've been try to get thi app to
run for the last coupl of dai without ani luck.
