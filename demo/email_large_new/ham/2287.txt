i'm us the squeez+kde4 version of debian live instal and it seem
to be lenni upgrad to squeez, it's definit broken becaus the
weather widget will not config, i've seen the problem befor on everi
lenni upgrad and it's the onli problem i can find, on that system i've
been abl to upgrad the kernel with no problem.

i would not recommend debian live to anyon look for a usabl system.
