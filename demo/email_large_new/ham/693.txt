in short ye. the more logic involv the longer
the cpu is execut it. i.e. there is more logic
execut (includ nic logic) when go down
to the metal than when us lo. so how much
logic is involv for each type of ipc (why
ar you limit yourself to socket? there ar
mutex, share mem, file, messag...). anywai the
best ipc method to choos is dictat by the data
you want to commun between the process,
as the variou ipc mechan ar tune for
variou data type.

ibm ar run a seri compar doze and linux ipc mechan.
the socket (which refer the other at the bottom) is here:
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerwork/linux/librari/l-rt6/?t=gr,redhat=socket

the follow in googl gave us info also:
"linux ipc mechan compar"

p√°draig.
