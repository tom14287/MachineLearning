i am log to syslog (the protocol) and replac syslog (the packag)
with syslog-ng. syslog-ng can be configur to do thi:

destin df_syslog {
        file("/var/log/$host/$year/$month/$dai/syslog"
        templat("$isod $host $msg\n")
        owner(root) group(root) perm(0600) dir_perm(0700) creat_dir(ye));
};

thi is a snip that configur a file in a directori-structur match
the hostnam and the date (you should be abl to guess the detail...)

http://www.syslog.org/syslog-ng/v2/ ha some more exampl.
