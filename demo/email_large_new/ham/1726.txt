if you ar us awt, you need to give your program access to the
consol.  appl us a mach-involv secur model of namespac to
control access to variou thing; you can find more inform on it at
http://develop.appl.com/mac/librari/technot/tn2005/tn2083.html.
worth read.  sever time.

but the pertin bit is ``a process can onli us the global window
server servic if it euid is 0 (it's run as root) or match the
uid of the consol user. all other user ar bar from us it.''

i don't see an updat of thi document for 10.6, either.
