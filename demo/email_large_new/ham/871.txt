[ilug] nf slow with suse 8.1nf as a protocol is not known for it speedi but thi is absurd. i did an 
nf instal of a box thi morn (that would be the box which won't boot 
from cd for those who were in irc) and it wa rather slow but i just left it 
to it. have got it up, i want to copi the dvd to a disk on it so i have it 
handi for instal ani further bit i might requir. so i simpli mount 
the nf export dvd on the new box and start copi. 

after a coupl of minut i look - it wa transfer about 8mb a minut. 
so i kill that and us rsync instead which is tick awai now at about 
100 mb/min - still not exactli turbo charg but a lot better than the nf 
rate. ani idea as to what's make it so slow ? there's realli no point in 
run more nfsd process, as there is exactli on client, so i'm a littl 
at a loss i must sai.
