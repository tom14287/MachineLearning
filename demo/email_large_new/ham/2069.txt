1)  i think the code is still veri much pre-beta.

2)  when you go to the "download" page, it tell you "fetch the latest
version of razor-agent and razor-agent-sdk packag"  it is not at all
clear that these ar develop packag.

the site is badli design, and veri mislead.  imo.  the fact that the
word "beta" appear in the middl of some introductori text on the front
page is hardli a valid argument.  (well accept softwar design "fact":
user don't read *anyth*)

i get the impress that vipul & co ar deliber try to mislead
user into download the dev code in order to get more unwit test
site.

but that's just my opinion, i could be wrong.

rod.
