i wa suffici intrigu by the (appar) absenc of a simpl mta
that doe the abov, so i decid to write my own: tmta.  it actual
work, and is document, although it's still pretti much in the
proof-of-concept stage:

http://sourceforg.net/project/tmta/

on import thing that it doe *not* (yet?) do is fork; it's current
implement as a basic, singl-thread daemon, so it can onli accept
on connect at a time.  it shouldn't be too difficult (famou last
word ...) to convert into a multi-thread model, although i have no
experi with that sort of thing.

it is still small, though - under 70 line of actual perl code,
although it doe, of cours, requir the basic perl instal and
about a half-dozen other modul.

if anyon ha ani feedback, or suggest for improv, i'd love
to hear them.
