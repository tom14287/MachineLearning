my domain smb knowledg is slightli rusti but here goe...

1. your samba server's ip address end with a 0, which, afaik, is
reserv for network address (unless it ha some special purpos
like the the /32 netmask). what is the output of "ifconfig -a"?

2. in your smb.conf:

2.a the follow ar miss (although thei mai be the default
set for these variabl):
secur =3d user
local master =3d ye

2.b i have forgotten why, but afaik "127.0.0.1" should be list in
"interfac =3d".

2.c what doe "share mode =3d no" do?

3. if you have not yet creat a comput account for the window box,
you have to log on to the domain as root (or as a user with the right
to add a machin account) the first time that you do so from a samba
client for the "add machin script =3d" variabl to do it magic.

4. the "_ldap._tcp...." dn srv record ar need for an ad domain
(iirc there ar 6 +-1). i have never set up an ad samba pdc but your
smb.conf set look like those of an nt4 samba pdc so it mai just
be a mislead error/failur messag. your window box seem to be an
xp vm but just in case the netbio name is mislead, see
