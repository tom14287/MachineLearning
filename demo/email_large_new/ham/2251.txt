ye ;)

first off, redhat doe not support upgrad from beta's to the releas 
version.  that doesn't mean it can't work, it mean nobodi tri it, thei 
sure didn't test it or fix anyth to make it work, and you're on your 
own.

second, histor a new .0 number mostli mean "so much ha been 
chang that you might have problem upgrad from ani previou releas 
anywai".  so, histor, most user instal a .0 releas do thi 
from scratch anywai, do upgrad throughout x.0->x.y.

if you want to avoid problem, bite the bullet and reinstal ;)
