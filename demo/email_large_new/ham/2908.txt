don't understand why thi would be the case.  i have a static =
initi in that class, and that's where it is load and call =
that nativ method.  how can the class not be found if that's where the =
nativ method is be call from?

think about it: you ar call your jni function from the class' static =
initi. the class is not initi yet. attempt to find the =
(uniniti) class should probabl fail.
