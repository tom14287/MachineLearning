if xfsprog is instal, then i think fsck will do it, just first run 
someth like:

tune2fs -c912 /dev/sda3

and reboot, where c is the capit 'c', 912 is some number larger than 
the current maximum mount count (befor automat fsck'ing) and 
substitut your actual devic path for the /dev/sda3 i us as an 
exampl.

i think xfsprog ha some other tool as well.

oh wait, i reread your question.


if the machin is in work order, you can just do:

#apt-get instal xfsprog

if not, then a live cd will be need, someth like knoppix, be sure 
it ha xf support.  just boot the live cd or dvd, and bob's your uncl.

i'm unsur, doe the debian squeez instal fulli support xf?
