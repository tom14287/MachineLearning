openssh-3.0.2p1-1

i think that is directli from openssh site. it's from the rh 6.2 that i 
upgrad to 7.2 (6.2 doesn't ship with openssh...). 

i probabl should downgrad to the versoin rh provid except i can't do 
that as i don't have physic access to that box and downgrad ssh 
packag over ssh doesn't sound like a bright idea...
