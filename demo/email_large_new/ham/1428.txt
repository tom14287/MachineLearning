i haven't tri 2.41 yet becaus it requir file::spec, which barf when
spamassassin tri to us it.  i haven't file a bug yet becaus i suspect it's
becaus i'm still run 5.005 perl becaus of report compat issu
with 5.6 and later, but i probabl will becaus i think there's too much legaci
perl code to put up with major compat problem, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of look, sai it need a newer on.  the perl @ stuff
wa bad enough...  but thi is all a separ soapbox...



------- you ar receiv thi mail becaus: -------
