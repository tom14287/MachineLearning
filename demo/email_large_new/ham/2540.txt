"10.00.custom" is the
default valu for --revis.  the fact that you see it in the packag
file name mean that it did not recogn the option.  try it thi wai:

   fakeroot make-kpkg clean
   fakeroot make-kpkg --append-to-version -recompil --revis x.x.xxx \
    --initrd kernel_imag kernel_header

note: you must alwai issu "make-kpkg clean" after run "make menuconfig"
or after run "make-kpkg" with ani target other than "clean".  otherwis,
version and revis number will not work as expect.  assum that you
ar us offici debian kernel sourc, you will want to make the valu
for --revis match the "version" of the linux-sourc-2.6.32 packag.
i know the web page i point you to is long and bore.  but the answer to
all of your problem ar in there.  where did you get your kernel sourc,
by the wai?  and why ar you compil a custom kernel in the first place?
