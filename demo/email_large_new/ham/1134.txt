  | i would encourag folk to plai with those 10 line of code in
  | text_select and report what work well for them.  we mai come up
  | with 8 line that work for everyon, or perhap introduc yet anoth
  | set that let folk choos between a few us model.  of cours,

i actual think you're look in the wrong place.   i, at least,
have almost no problem with the choic of what get past, or
select, that stuff (for me, if perhap not user of some gnome variant,
which appraent ha been fix anywai) all seem to work just fine.

the problem is that a button 1 click clear the select (primari)
where it shouldn't - the previou select should onli be clear
when there's someth els to replac it (even if the highlight
of what is select is remov).     try thi in ani other ramdom
applic (from xterm to netscap) and see how it work.  there
normal is *no* (mous base) wai to actual clear the primari
select (that is, set it to be a null string).

then, becaus of the "if i get ask for the select valu, i will
find someth" behaviour, if you click (intend to set the insert
point, the wai most other gui's oper), and then past, becaus the
primari is clear, but exmh still own the select, becaus noth
els ha taken it, it doe and find some other ramdom stuff, from
either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tend to be someth that wa
delet back in the ancient past, and past that.

that behaviour, to me anywai, is the real issu.

onc that get fix, we can switch back to oper the normal
"select stuff, click at new insert point, past" mode of oper
that almost everyon expect to work (whether the "select stuff"
is somewher in on of the exmh window, or elsewher).

kre

ps: thi messag is from my experi as a exmh user onli, i've never
realli understood enough about x and select to go gaze at that
part of the code and see how it all realli oper.
