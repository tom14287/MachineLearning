it's a myth that we don't us part of our brain.  we us it all,
alwai.  it's just that our cultur-induc focal-point caus most
of us to most of the time ignor and wast 99.999% of it.  "lucid" is
a measur of notch-filter bandwidth; all station ar broadcast,
but we onli /choos/ easi rock 105.

for exampl, don't look now but your shoe ar full of feet.

the sensat of toe the abov statement evok is not a "turn on"
of circuit, it is a "tune in".  the next step, of cours, is to
"drop out" :)

to paraphras an old saw: life is wast on the live.
