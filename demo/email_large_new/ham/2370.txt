valuabl ye, sinc it provid us video process app. i'm us
it also sinc recent. it probabl is reliabl, although for me it did

good to know.

how come there is no link anywher on debian.org point to
debian-multimedia.org? anyth to establish a chain of trust. as it is,
i look and look but didn't find. even when search for
"multimedia" on debian.org, it doe not mention debian-multimedia.org at
all. not even when search for "debian-multimedia". everi new debian
user try to verifi the credibilitii of debian-multimedia.org would
have given up at thi point for sure.

with the inform that marillat is a debian develop (and the
precis spell of hi name) i wa actual abl to go to the
develop's page on debian org, find him, and see a link to d-m. so in a
veri roundabout wai, d-m is actual endors by debian.org. but how
would anybodi find out about thi in a reason amount of time?
