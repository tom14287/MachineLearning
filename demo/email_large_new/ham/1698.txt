isight - setframeratehi all,

with respect to my problem that the video callback is trigger more =
often than i want to (see below) i had a guess that it is relat to the =
devic frame rate. in that context i tri to set the frame rate of my =
inbuilt isight to 1 and sggetframer did confirm thi:=20

  err =3d sgsetframer(videodata->sgchanvideo,inttofix(1));
  fix *framer;
  sggetframer(videodata->sgchanvideo,framer);
  int rate =3d fixedtoint(*framer);
  cout << "framer: " << rate << endl;  //// plot 1 when execut

howev, when i execut the app the frame size is much higher (i guess =
30 fp or more). i saw an older post from 2007, which dealt with the =
same problem of not be abl to set the inbuilt ichat frame rate but =
nobodi repli. doe anyon have a guess how to approach thi problem ?

thank in advanc

hi all,

i have a thread, which trigger the sgidl call accord to my desir =
frame rate:

void video::run(){
 while (run){
   sj->dfc->videoblock->lock();
   sj->dfc->videowait->wait(sj->dfc->videoblock);

   err =3d sgidl(videodata->seqgrab);
   usleep(1000000/1);   //// framer

   sj->dfc->videoblock->unlock();
 }
}

in thi exampl the thread wait for 1 second befor execut the next =
time, which result in a frame rate of 1 fp. howev, i discov some =
 strang system behavior, which forc me to verifi if thi is realli =
the case: i appli a time measur between each data proc function =
call and in fact it is execut 4 more time in between in approx. 250 =
microsecond interv. in the follow i have plot the measur =
interv time in ms:

1000.38
0.026
0.023
0.024
0.027
1002.55
0.025
0.026

0.02
1000.18
0.026
0.137
0.025
0.024

etc .... and so forth. thi is actual not happen when i resid =
abov a framer of 25 fp. can anyon tell me why thi is happen =
and how i can prevent thi to happen ?=20

thank a lot in advanc, best
