given that you have (presum) instal some or all 'openjdk' 
packag, you could get a list of the instal file, per packag, and 
see if ani of the name list point to anyth of "interest".

file in /etc, /etc/... (where ... might be 'openjdk'?), file in /lib 
or /usr/lib that ar not librari file, etc. could either be the sourc, 
or point to other file to check.

thi is a 'brute forc' sort of techniqu, but it ha help me in a 
coupl of case where all els had fail.
