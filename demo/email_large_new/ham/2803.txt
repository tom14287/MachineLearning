well, that doesn't help you read your list.

i think you're talk about ipfilt, and openbsd's new pf code.
now who's talk fud :)

perhap, although i think when serious consid someth like
a firewal, tri and trust mean a hell of a lot. ipfilt would
probabl win that race.

i wa talk in term of the actual firewal. if the compani in
question know plenti about linux and noth about freebsd, i'd go
with a linux box, mere becaus when someth goe wrong (that
isn't got to do with ipfw/ipchain/ipfilt), then someon know how
to fix it.

as i said befor, i have littl to no in-depth experi with
netfilt, i'm awar of it's basic capabl and had a quick look
at it's featur in earli 2.4 edit but that's it.
