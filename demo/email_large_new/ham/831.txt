it look ok to me; your custom rule file is read by udev (line 24) and
the correspond variabl ar set (line 110-116).

i now tri to activ the extra option in the fdi file that come
with xserver-xorg-input-synapt and that gave me right-edg-scroll
and the other stuff. thu it seem that the fdi direct ar work
right now on my sid system. (as i wrote earlier, i have not us these

work all the time or if thi function wa onli recent
restor.)

i suggest that you try the same approach and then we can compar our
result. in other word:

1) shut down x and remov your custom udev rule for the time be,
   then restart udev. (invok-rc.d udev restart)

2) uncom the extra rule in

   to close the comment in the "" to
   the end of thi line; also insert a new line with "
