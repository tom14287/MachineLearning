what about the carrot approach?  find an even better 
backup method, compat with grub 2 and appeal 
to your manag for it effici.

or what about put grub on a usb flash which can 
be replic easili and is larg independ of 
your main non-volatil storag.  the flash fail 
and you plug in anoth.  main storag fail and 
you invok the tradit backup.
