ok, some more nit: alsa-xmm doesn't work if i don't have
alsa-lib-devel instal, but xmm di on startup tell me:

   cannot load alsa librari: libasound.so: cannot open share object
   file: no such file or directori

libasound.so is part of alsa-lib-devel... if i instal it, the alsa xmm
output plugin work fine.

i can't instal the xine stuff, becaus xine-lib need libglcor.so.1,
which i can't find anywher (nvidia stuff?  i have radeon 7500...)
