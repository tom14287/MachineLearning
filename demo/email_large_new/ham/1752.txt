the out-of-process plugin2 should work fine on 32-bit onli mac.

switch between the in and out-of-process plugin is a simpl matter =
of ad or remov a symlink to the in-process plugin to =
/librari/internet plug-in. you should onli see grei radio button in =
java prefer if you don't have write permiss in that directori. =
it's possibl that if you have other java plugin present in your =
~/librari/internet plug-in folder, that could be confus the =
logic...mayb.

can you "ls -al@e /librari/internet\ plug-in" and "ls -al@e =
~/librari/internet\ plug-in" to see what plugin ar present, and if =
there ar ani funni acl or extend attribut?

best of luck,
