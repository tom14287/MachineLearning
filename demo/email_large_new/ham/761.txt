gnome crash when .xsession file is present.if i creat an empti (0 length) .xsession or an .xsession file
contain on line, sai, echo hello, world, i get thi error when i
try to log into gnome.

your session last less than 10 second. if you have not log out
yourself thi could mean there is some instal problem or that you
mai be out of disk space. try log in with on of the failsaf
session to see if you can fix the problem.

there aren't ani error in .xsession-error when i try to log in with
the 0 length .xsession file. in case of the .xsession file with echo
hello, world, i see just 'hello, world' in the .xsession-error file.

why doe thi happen?
