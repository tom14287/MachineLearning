wa there ani scienc in there? all i saw wa more of the "myth of the 
liber media." everi opinion support global warm wa "the media", 
everi opinion against it wa an "expert." a brief perus of the rest of 
the web site and i'm left wonder where the scienc
is.
and, to put on my extremist hat, everi organ or scientist in 
there wa american. big deal - a bunch of scientist be trot out 
to support govern and industri polici that is the ultim sourc 
of their livelihood and research monei. if the govern chang their 
mind on kyoto, thei'll trot out anoth group of tame scientist. and 
all the american paper will switch back to warn us about climat chang.

owen
