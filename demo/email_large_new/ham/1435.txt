the thing i miss most in kde4 is: paus the cursor over a music
file in konq (file manag, icon view) and hear the content.
thi wa such an awesom featur that microsoft ha copi it for
window 7; and it's disappear from konq/dolphin. i ask about it
onc, and got  back.

otherwis, i'm a happi kde4.4 user (on a number of distro).

ani chanc?
