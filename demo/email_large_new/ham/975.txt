my point wa exactli that.  for user who run tight, tini, custom kernel
either without initrd (such as myself) or with tini initrd tailor to a
specif hardwar config, lilo should be allow as an option for these user.

grub is bloat becaus it is design to accommod bloat.  lilo is the
antithesi of bloat.

mani op don't need or want lilo to be abl to accommod bloat kernel
imag or initrd.  the current version of lilo is fine.  we just want the
option to be abl to us lilo becaus our kernel imag aren't bloat, and
grub is a pita to work with, and is unnecessari on our system.
