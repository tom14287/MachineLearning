i am delurk to comment on the salon articl. i just want to sai that i am grate thei choos not to publish my forbidden thought. i sent it in a coupl of dai befor the 9/11 commer. if i had just watch the sentiment network and cabl show on 9/11 my cynic thought would have remain unchang. howev, i watch the frontlin show "faith and doubt at ground zero" on pb. that show tackl head on, with much more courag than i have seen elsewher, the larger question about good and evil, about art as an altern religion (karlheinz stockhausen -- 9/11 wa a great work of art), and especi the question about how religion ha a darker side which when carri to fanat extrem tend to negat the human of the non-believ.
i am not a religi person but i stun at the scope of thi program. it talk about the lutheran minist who spoke at yanke stadium on a podium with other religi leader present who wa charg with heresi by hi own church for promot the idea that all religion ar equal (presum the lutheran have the on true path?).
thank for listen, i just felt like i need to put the word out about thi program. my shallow comment on salon and other like it (my boyfriend and i had sex while the tower collaps) give me paus about how some of us tend to harden ourselv to the suffer of other.
