and i claim he would be better off us a card that doesn't us firmwar[1=
]=20
or us free firmwar, sinc non-free firmwar is an issu for distributor=
=20
and it's rel easi to "accident" particip in distribut=20
softwar in violat of it licens.

i wouldn't want to be stuck without non-free avail, but i recommend mak=
ing=20
hardwar purchas that allow you to avoid non-free as much as possibl.  i=
'm=20
gradual move that wai myself.  (desktop and laptop each need on driver=
=20
from non-free.)

onc you've got the hardwar, you might as well us it, even if it requir=
=20
non-free driver.  the manufactur ha alreadi got their cut of what you=20
paid; you ar hurt none but yourself by not us it.  you should try an=
d=20
avoid becom depend on that hardwar, sinc that make you depend o=
n=20
non-free softwar.

[1] "firmwar" here is specif limit to execut data transmit =
to=20
the devic from a host oper system, and doe not includ execut da=
ta=20
load from an eeprom (or similar) that is provid with the devic.
