don't run sa on mail thi larg. most peopl tend to ignor mail 
larger than about 250k in spamassassin process, becaus it just kill 
perform. there ar some known issu with the pars (such as the 
html pars stuff which is much improv in 2.40 which we're soon to 
releas), but noth that's too like to be fix by 2.40. perhap in 
2.50 though.

matt.
