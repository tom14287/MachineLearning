migrat from lenni to squeez (or ani migrat, realli) is tricki.
you can't just chang your /etc/apt/sourc.list file to point to the
squeez repositori and then do "aptitud updat;aptitud full-upgrad".
the problem you ar describ abov is onli the first of your problem
if you have done that.  you need to follow the upgrad outlin mention
in the releas note.  you didn't sai how you did it, and it's too late
in ani case, but i just want to mention that while we're on the subject.

assum that you did the migrat properli, thi mai be a devic name
issu.  there's been some problem with devic name recent, particularli
with id hard disk.  it hasn't happen to me, but other have report
devic name go from /dev/hdx to /dev/sdx and back again with
subsequ mainten.  you mai have to boot from a rescu disk,
edit your /etc/fstab to chang devic name, accord to what thei
ar now, and rebuild your initi ram file system.

if that is the issu, an altern to tradit devic name is
to us uuid.
