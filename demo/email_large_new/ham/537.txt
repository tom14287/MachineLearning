after discov an open wireless net avail from hi sofa, steven 
"hacker" levi interview lawmen, academ and wifi activist about the 
legal and ethic of us open wireless access point. 

    i download my mail and check media new on the web. when i confess 
    thi to fbi agent bill shore, he spare the handcuff. "the fbi wouldn't 
    wast resourc on that," he snif. now i know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argu that i broke a law. what's more, i certainli didn't feel 
    illeg. becaus—and thi is the point of all that war-drive and 
    -chalk and node-stumbl—when you get us to wireless, the experi 
    feel more and more like a god-given right. on dai we mai breath 
    bandwidth like oxygen—and argu it illeg will be unthink.
