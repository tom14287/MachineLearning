thi is exactli the problem i saw when i updat x11 to 2.5.0 (mous 
button 2 send leav/notifi instead of buttonpress or buttonreleas), and 
as a matter of fact i went so far as to open a ticket on it.  it wa 
mark invalid a short while later when i report that the problem went 
awai with a reboot.



sinc that ticket wa close, i have seen the same problem on a second 
system run 10.5.8 (a powerbook g4 15").  a reboot also solv the 
problem on the second system.  unfortun i haven't seen the problem 
appear again on either of my two system, so i can't offer ani help in 
root caus it.
