re: snow leopard, java 6 and netbeansha anyon tri it with the 10m3050 or 9m3150 develop preview? i'm =
somewhat concern that thi is a demonstr regress between java 5 =
and java 6 - howev there ar sever other factor that can impact =
memori us:

- 32 vs. 64-bit (biggest culprit)
- 1.5/client/32-bit tune garbag collect option run on =
1.6/server/64-bit
- client vs. server hotspot itself (more aggress compil and =
storag of compil code)

anecdot, i've talk to sever peopl who have larg long run =
64-bit process on snow leopard with 2gb-of-ram machin who were =
have a miser time. while revert to 32-bit mai be a quick fix =
for some, other who tune the gc paramet or turn on =
-xx:+usecompressedoop (which compress java refer to 32-bit =
valu in the heap) found that thei could reclaim or even exce their =
origin 32-bit perform (sinc thei were still us the server =
jvm).

sinc someon mention that netbean 6.9 beta wa work well, i'd =
suggest take a look at it's jvm option and see if there wasn't some =
tweak done to optim it for a 64-bit by default world.

best of luck,
