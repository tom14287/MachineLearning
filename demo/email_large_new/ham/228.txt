the default score for bondedsend-certifi domain is -10, but i do not
believ thei should be trust and encourag you to chang the default.

* there is no document on their websit about how i can complain about
  thi and have their custom financi penal for send me unsolicit
  mail.
* what proof do ani of us have that thei realli even do anyth about it?
  their contract is with their custom, not with us.

thi is a scam!  don't trust them!
