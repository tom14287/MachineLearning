  | how about someth like:
  | 
  |    cd {dest.dir}
  |    tar -c {sourc.dir} cf - | tar xf -
  | 
  | tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. thi
  | should keep permiss and link, and if you do it as root you will keep
  | the owner too... :)
  | 
  | not test, though. you mai need other flag as well.

 the abov (or someth close to it) will work.

 howev, the data will be read and written twice by the
 1st (sourc) `tar', and read twice by the 2nd (sink) `tar',
 albeit onli written onc as the sink realiz the second
 copi is a hard link to the first.  with c.60gb of data,
 that will make a differ, at least in time and cpu
 resourc consum (albeit, in thi case, not storag).

 the issu here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archiv alwai
 contain the data for each name of a hard link.  thi is
 (probabl) for sever reason, and is not necessarili a
 bad thing.   e.g., it provid a degre of redund to
 help cope with bad media.

 the sourc `tar' is creat an archiv, which is be
 written down the pipe (to be consum by the sink `tar').
 that is why storag is not an issu per se here, as the
 full archiv is not "save" --- if it were, you'd need
 at least 2x60gb, or over 120gb!   (the extra is `tar's
 overhead, which is minim but doe add up, esp. when
 a "larg" block factor is us.)

cheer!
