good question.  thi wa cover in on of the amateur rag, mayb sky
and telescop or even scienterrif american, long befor there wa ani
web to speak of, but you'd think a 400km gash in the earth would be
pretti easi to find ;) i rememb it from an issu perhap in the veri
late 80's or earli 90's.

it's interest to note that nt7 and mani other neo bodi ar all on
trajectori that approach the earth from under the eclipt, so with
the earth tilt, south america becom a pretti good target.  in try
to find you a site through googl, i turn up sever differ
impact site in venezuela and brazil, with ag rang from 251m to
70 year, but not the 400km gash from the abov stori.  

the onli googl ref i found from that period is on in arizona
(famou impact crater) and anoth in nm; do wish i had note the
actual south american /countri/ that contain the scar; venezuela
stick in my mind but i can't be certain.
