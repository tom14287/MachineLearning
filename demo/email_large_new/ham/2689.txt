i don't work in thi area, but i have a suspicion that mani peopl
suspect project for "knowledg manag" and "knowledg share" as
attempt to elimin their job, or at least their import. if "the
organ" know all the thing i know, why doe it need me?

thi should actual be easi to test experiment: compar the result
of have someon call up and sai, "can you show us how to do x for thi
project we're work on?" with those of have someon summon by a
knowledg manag project to explain how to do x for the knowledg
archiv.
