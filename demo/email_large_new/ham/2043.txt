updat jre in lenni-----begin pgp sign messag-----
hash: sha1

a websit i want to us would allow access unless my java applet is jre
6 updat 13 or higher.  as far as i can figur out the applet provid
by packag sun-java6-bin is updat 12.

- from the sun microsystem site i download file jre-6u19-i586.bin;
move it to directori /usr/lib/jvm, chang ownership to root:root and
permiss to rwxr-xr-x and ran the binari.  it creat a new directori
/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.6.0_19 and open in that directori a number of
subdirectori and file.

next, i need to add thi new jre to /etc/altern.  us the
altern configur provid by packag galtern, as root i
select 'java' as the altern to configur and ad to the option
list /usr/lib/jvm/1.6.0_19/bin/java and final select thi new option.

after reload iceweasel, about:plugin still show the previou jre i
wa us, /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java.

assum that i can us a later version of jre download from sun on
iceweasel 3.5, am i on the right track but did not get the newer version
set up correctli, or is there a differ wai?
