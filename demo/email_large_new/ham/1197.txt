which mean it ha been umount.

i get the same behaviour than you, but onli when i attach a special 
devic (gnome recogn the mobil phone as some kind of music stuff). 

try thi:

1/ plug on the devic
2/ type mount (to get the devic list)
3/ type "umount /media/video" (adjust the command to point the right path)
4/ type "mount"

with these step i get no pop-up or warn messag and the devic get 
umount normal.

greet,
