re: [ilug] cv question?well, as mani have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.

i did try just cv'ing over the exist sourc, but cv complain that my 
file were in the wai.

then i thought that i'd onli need the dri stuff, that took about 1.5 hour to 
fetch 116m. unfortun i still need the xfree86 cv stuff as well :-( at 
339m that took almost 3 hour.

now i can start build the xfree86 cv and dri cv stuff for test the 3d 
patch for my gvx1 card. i just hope i don't complet trash my system in 
the process. 

think i'll wait until morn to start build, though. i've been build a 
new box from sourc thi week. a 200mhz pentiummmx with 96m. it took a full 
dai to build xfree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 dai each to build qtlib and kdelib. 
kdebas took just under 46 hour. i've got lot of grief from the wife for 
the comput run 'round the clock thi week. the rest of kde should build 
in under 20 hour increment.

cheer,

	john gai
