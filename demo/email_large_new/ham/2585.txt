us samba with unix aclshi all,

i am set up a file server for a small compani. the peopl who will 
be us it want to be abl to control who access particular 
directori on a user/group basi. i origin thought that it would be 
enough to set up a standard samba system with unix home directori, 
plu share for each group of user (admin / tech etc.), but thei ar 
keen to have a system which allow them to make some part of the 
filesystem avail to more than on group, which as far as i know 
isn't support by thi kind of setup. (unless i were to have share for 
each possibl combin of group...)

i think that to achiev thi i will need to set up samba with unix acl, 
but i'm not sure what's the best wai of do thi - the two option 
seem to be us a patch kernel with an ext3 filesystem, or els us 
the xf filesystem which ha built in acl support. which of these would 
you recommend?

the xf option seem a lot simpler to maintain (no need to patch the 
kernel everi time an updat is releas), but i'm worri that becaus 
thi filesystem is not us so much, it mai not be as reliabl as ext3.

thank for ani help with thi,

andi baxter, lancast uk.
