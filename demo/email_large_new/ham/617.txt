michael's minut: do the math...dispel the myth 

a report came by the lindow.com   offic
last fridai. he told me that he want to try and us
 lindowso to
write a stori, but he didn't think it wa possibl becaus hi offic
us microsoft word .doc file. i ask him to have a seat and watch.  

i turn on the walmart.com  comput
and then click on the run man  
which took me to the click-n-run warehous
  where i instal openoffic
  us click-n-run. i then click
the "run it"  button which open the word processor openoffic writer.
i then type "linux is readi for the desktop and consum can save
hundr us lindowso." i select "save as microsoft word."

the report wa not onli surpris, he wa amaz. like mani report,
he wa under the impress that linux wa onli for server. the simpl
word processor demonstr went a long wai to show him otherwis. for
linux to becom a drive forc in desktop comput it will have to
overcom a coupl of myth. 

the first myth is that linux is too hard to instal and configur. that
mai have been true in the past, but we've annihil thi myth with the
latest version of lindowso --which instal on most machin in under 5
minut. it's point- and-shoot easi - easier than ani other oper
system (microsoft product includ). see for yourself at  .  

the other myth is that linux is just for the server and none of the
graphic program --which desktop user have come to reli on-- exist.
not onli have mani of the linux softwar program made quantum leap
over the last coupl of year, but thei've gotten quit good at read
and write microsoft format. the easiest wai to experi these
product is via the click-n-run  
warehous.

 here's a quick list of some of the qualiti program avail todai in
the warehous  all download and
instal with a singl click:

openoffic - thi on instal will equip a comput with an
impress collect of product program each of which will open
the correspond microsoft file format and allow you to edit file and
swap them with microsoft counterpart. 
program includ ar:

openoffic writer - word processor (read microsoft word doc) 
openoffic calc - spreadsheet (read microsoft excel) 
openoffic impress- present packag (read microsoft powerpoint)
openoffic draw - a vector base draw program

click here   for a great
tutori on get to know openoffic.

gimp  if you ar familiar with adob's photoshop,
you'll want to click-n-run gimp. it's a power imag editor. 
 

evolut  for those us to microsoft's
outlook email program evolut will make them feel right at home. check
out how easi it is to us  .

flowchart pro, which is similar to microsoft's visio, is a  rich
chart program that make it possibl to creat flow chart and
organiz chart, plu more. see how easi it for yourself, visit
flowchart pro at 

thi is just a hand of the qualiti program avail in the
warehous  that make linux a practic choic
for the desktop todai. and if you're still not convinc, then do the
math.

 
for  a total cost of $499  , includ
all  softwar, comput user save  more than $800  for a complet
system. 

with such major price differenti between the two similarli equip
system, ani busi, school or home will find their comput dollar
stretch much further run lindowso.
