[ilug] mutt repli hook
hi all,

i have 3 or 4 email address (which get us for differ
reason), and i'd prefer not to mix them up. so i wa wonder
if anyon know of a wai that i can have mail (apart from list
mail, which i have alreadi sort) which arriv to a certain
e-mail address have the from: header in the repli automat
set to the address it came to.

for exampl, sai i have a compani, and sale@compani.com,
info@compani.com and tech@compani.com arriv in the same mailbox.
i don't want to repli to sale@compani.com mail with the from:
set to dave@compani.com, i would like the mail to come from
sale@compani.com.

is there ani wai to do thi? bear in mind that mail can arriv
with my email in the to or cc field (and bcc?), and it might be
buri in a coupl of dozen other recipi...

cheer,
dave.
