thi is hardli a new book.  in fact, it wa written in the dai of woodi.
(woodi -> sarg -> etch -> lenni -> squeez)
and part of it ar obsolet.  but the author focus on the core stuff of
unix/linux, and so most of it is still current.  it's an excel guid
for how to accomplish common comput task in linux, usual with a
command line tool, and the author ha a clear bent toward debian.
