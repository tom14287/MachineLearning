kmail doesn't us akonadi at all in kde 4.4. it might us akonadi in kde=20
4.5. the onli thing us akonadi by default in kde 4.4 is the new=20
kaddressbook. afaik.

so kde 4.5 might even be more problemat in the begin. especi=20
when i rememb the rough of kde 4.3.0 and kde 4.4.0 i do not=20
suggest to ship a .0 or even .1 releas of kde. even kde 4.4.2 had quit=20
some bug that kde 4.4.3 fix.

so ship kde 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 oder 4.4.5 imho could well be a better=20
option that to ship kde 4.5.0 with debian squeez.

sadli i have not seen ani kde 4.x.0 releas yet that realli suitabl for=20
debian stabl.

ciao,
