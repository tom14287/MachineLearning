re: co2 and climat (wa re: goodby global warm)ok, let's bring some data into the discuss:
http://www.grida.no/climat/vital/02.htm
(a graph, deriv from vostok ic core sampl, of co2 and temperatur
fluctuat over the past 400k year).

base on the vostok data, you ar right, there is a veri strong correl
between temperatur and co2 concentr, but it doesn't alwai appear to
be causal.

also correct -- the peak of each cycl is at about 290-300 ppm co2.

not correct. mauna loa data  and
 show that the current co2
concentr ar at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* record
valu from the past 400k year. furthermor, co2 concentr ar grow
at 15ppm everi 10 year, much faster than ani record increas in the
vostok data (though perhap the vostok data isn't capabl of such fine
resolut).

> in other word, we mai be ad to the co2 level,

no, we ar *definit* ad to co2 level. look at the follow chart:
http://www.grida.no/climat/vital/07.htm
(show co2 concentr sinc 1870, the "histor record").

not onli is the co2 increas over 130 year unpreced in the vostok
record, it is clear that the rate of chang is *increas*, not decreas.
there is no other compel explan for thi increas, except for
anthropogen input. you're realli out on the fring if you're debat
thi -- even global warm skeptic gener conced thi point.

wrong again. current co2 level ar current unpreced over the past
400k year, unless there is some mechan that allow co2 level to quickli
spike, and then return back to "normal" background level (and henc the
spike might not show up in the ic core).

still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reach 500 ppm co2, a level that
even you would have a hard time argu awai.

ye, cloud and ocean ar a big unknown. still, we know ocean water ha a
finit capac to store co2, and if the world temperatur doesn't increas,
but we all have seattl-like weather all the time, the effect would be
enorm.

correct.

data on rel contribut of greenhous gass:
http://www.grida.no/climat/vital/05.htm

note that methan concentr now ar *much* higher than pre-industri
level (mani cow fart, and rice paddi outgass), and methan is also
a contributor in the format of atmospher water vapor. anoth clearli
anthropogen increas in a greenhous ga. i'm in favor of reduct in
methan level as well.

data on water vapor here:

i tend to think that holist, and techic approach would work best in
reduc global warm. i favor an energi polici that ha a mix of solar,
wind and nuclear, with all carbon-base combust us renew sourc
of c-h bond. aggress pursuit of carbon sink strategi also make sens
(buri tree deep underground, for exampl). approach that involv
reduct in lifestyl to a "sustain" level ar unrealist --
american just won't do it (you'd be surpris at the number of climat
chang research drive suv). but, as california show dure last
year's energi crisi, shift in pattern of consumpt ar possibl, and
improv effici is an easi sell.
