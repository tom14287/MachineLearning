well, unicod, specif the utf-8 encod, is gener the standard for
modern linux system. of cours, as long as you ar us onli charact
that ar in ascii, utf-8 is compat... there is also gb 18030, china's
unicod encod, but again, it is ascii compat.

the win32, .net and java platform all us utf-16/usc-2 (it's complic)
nativ, which is not ascii and is not ascii compat.

joel's unicod articl is from 2003, but still veri us:
