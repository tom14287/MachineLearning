if i go to a class, i'm there to learn.  if thei throw in anthem or
polit, i'll take what i can learn from that and i'll take in a new
perspect, but i'll onli do that with my critic think cap on.
just like i do when i watch mass media.  and ye, from the on irish
cours i took in dublin, thei do the nation anthem.  which is fine
realli - i start off each dai in school in america with the pledg of
allegi (with the under god bit in it which annoi my dad to no end).
if that sort of thing didn't stick at the ag of five, i sever doubt
it will stick now.
