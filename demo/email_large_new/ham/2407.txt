i assum that how much the trust goe down depend of the proport of 
report vs revok. if everybodi except on sai that a mail is spam, the 
on gui will see hi trust go down dramat. if you ar with the 
major, your trust goe up. if you ar against the major, your 
trust goe down. if peopl 50-50, whatev you vote, your neither 
against the major nor with it, so your trust won't chang. so your
"grai" mail won't have much influenc on your trust (neither good nor 
bad, just... grai)
