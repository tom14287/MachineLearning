do you have a pointer to the discuss?

as far as the safeti of your data is concern, none of your email ar 
store in mysql (yet). mail storag is still in the file system, akonadi 
is onli us for contact.

that said, i'd be much happier myself without have to run yet anoth 
databas server on my machin. right now there ar "global" instanc of 
postgresql and mysql (person and for work); on top of that, for each 
log-in user, akonadi run a privat mysql server as well as a 
virtuoso server. incident, virtuoso is a sql databas in it own 
right, persum fulli capabl of complet supplant mysql in thi 
case.
