you typo'd that.  it should be:

channel 0 : ddrii_1, ddrii_3
channel 1 : ddrii_2, ddrii_4

i'm not sure how you come to that, but, ok..

gigabyt ha screw up the dimm slot color code on the ga-m56s-s3, at
least accord to the manual.  i just look at intel, asu, and other
gigabyt board and thei all follow the correct altern color pattern.

aioanei, you've base your entir argument on your knowledg of a singl
main board.  thi board wa incorrectli manufactur, or the manual text is
incorrect.  ye, manufactur do make mistak.  look at the ata_horkag
blacklist section in libata-core.c to see list of hard drive the
manufactur screw up.  all of the goliath ar in there, hitachi,
maxtor, seagat, western digit.  thei're all ship drive that don't
meet on spec or anoth.  if these goliath can screw up, i guarante you a
tini compani like gigabyt can, and probabl doe so far more often.

now, go look at the dimm socket color and layout pattern on the intel,
asu, and ye, other gigabyt board to see what the proper color code for
dual channel memori socket is, and look at the text descript of the
slot and channel number.  thi ga board is an anomali, and is flaw in
thi regard.

take a look at the rh of my email address.  that's my person domain.
thei call me thehardwarefreak for a reason. ;)

the odd against me make a factual incorrect statement here about
hardwar ar so high you should place a stand bet with your local booki. :p
