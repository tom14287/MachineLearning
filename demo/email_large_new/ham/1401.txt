irish is taught badli in school. but then again so is french. i did 3 year
of french in primari school and 6 in secondari school. so, that's 9 year of
french. which, i guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languag.
as it turn out, my french is crap. my irish is much better. 

the problem seem to be the braindead attempt to make peopl learn languag
thei can't speak through read and write. and then tack on speech as
an afterthought. wherea do it the other wai round would be a lot more
us...

i hear thi complaint a lot, but i never hear peopl complain about be
"forc" to learn to read and write, or to do math. mayb peopl don't mind
as much if it is perceiv as a us skill (which irish is not usual
perceiv as).

anywai, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)
