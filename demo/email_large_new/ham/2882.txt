how to flush cach of certain disk?hi,

on my netbook i'm us automat usb stick mount through udev rule,
and i alreadi us to run 'sync' command befor unplug stick,
so no data will be lost. but if i have few stick insert and some
inform copi on on of them, if i run 'sync' i have to wait
while copi end, becaus:

a) sync command drop cach on disk, but copi process fill it
again; sync will work until all the cach ar drop to disk
b) i can't unplug stick when it stop to flash becaus i can't be sure
that there ar no more part of cach need to be flush on that
disk.

so here is my question - how can i run sync for onli on devic?

with best regard,
alexand batischev
