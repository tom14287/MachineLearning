i've got an old apc rm1400net in the bottom of my home rack back just on
server at the moment, a rare us crt, and my comm gear.  i get about an
hour out of it dure a total outag.  i bought it us from a local "off
leas equip" resel/liquid.  gave just over $100 usd for it.  the
batteri pack last 6 month.  bought a replac pack from batteri.com
for a littl over $100 with ship.  i've got over 4 year on the current
batteri pack.  averag lifespan on the 1400 pack is 5-7 year depend on
the number and durat of invert cycl.  as with you, thi is on of the
smartest hardwar purchas i ever made.  the electron and electr
part in ups veri rare fail, so as long as you replac batteri everi 5
year or so you'd got reliabl power backup, and cheap--$20 per year
basic for batteri.  thi level of power (and piec of mind) protect
cost less per year than on trip to the movi theater to see avatar.

i've got an equal old minuteman 650 floor model back my home
workstat.  again i purchas thi on us from a liquid (differ
on in thi case) for around $40 back in 1998.  i've replac the batteri
onc after 6 year and am about readi to replac it again.  the batteri for
thi on run around $40.

todai you can bui a 700kva class consum up for $100.  if the batteri
last you 5 year, you've paid $20/year for power/surg and data protect.
 not to mention conveni.

i can't imagin ever go without a up, whether server or workstat.
laptop ar great becaus, for all practic purpos, you get a free up
built in.
