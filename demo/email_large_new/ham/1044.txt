  just so thi isn't left hang, the reason i sai thi shouldn't
happen is that it *us* to happen and i fix it.  there were two wai
you could get broken hold, and i fix on in version 0.4.11:

  * the aptitud depend resolv will now refus to adjust held
    packag or instal forbidden version unless you manual allow
    it to.  thi behavior can be disabl by set
    aptitud::problemresolv::allow-break-hold to "fals".

    aptitud will still break hold when packag ar be
    automat instal; there is a pend patch against apt that
    elimin thi behavior.

  and the other in 0.5.9rc1:

  + [all] aptitud now us the new hook in apt to prevent the greedi
          resolv from remov packag or break hold.

          (close: #177374, #205049, #374353, #376802, #406506,
                   #430816, #434731, #442420, #452589)

  i am not, at present, awar of ani other circumst where aptitud
wrongli break hold.  that said, i don't put packag on hold veri
often, so i depend on user to send bug report if thei're see that
behavior.
