you're kid, right? you can push twice the data, which mean faster
cpu to memori util for cpu intens applic. flash anyon?

it's veri relev. you must not have run into thi issu much. 4:4
kernel split ar the best you can do on a 32-bit system, but it come
at a perform cost. split and perform ar never an issu on
64-bit until you've reach 17 eb of ram.

whether he will or won't isn't the issu. i'm not discuss us case,
i'm discuss the fact on why 64-bit is superior to 32-bit.

i'll give you an exampl. us xf on lvm, and export the mount over nf.
the nest system call in thi scenario will caus a kernel oop on ani
4k 32-bit kernel nearli everi time (the default for debian gnu/linux,
fedora, ubuntu, opensus, etc). on a 64-bit kernel, becaus you have the
abil to make deeper nest system call, you have stabil in your
infrastructur. someth that couldn't be achiev with a 32-bit kernel.=

the same would be said for a 32-bit applic implement the same
wai. poor softwar develop is hardli an argument against choos a
cpu architectur.

to each their own. i for on want to get my monei out of my hardwar. if
you don't want a 64-bit system, then why did you pai for it?
