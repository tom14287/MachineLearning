if all you're do is append to a log file then you're write-intens.
for exampl, some inn server us cycbuff ar write-intens if thei can
forward the articl out to the peer befor thei disappear from cach.

oltp databas have indic (or hash tabl or whatev) that need to be
read even when write a new record.  then of cours, the data that ha been
written need to be us for someth such as fulfil and analysi.
both ar mostli read.  backup from the live db is all read.

i typic saw about 90% read in oltp databas.

i think thi is get off-topic for debian-user.
