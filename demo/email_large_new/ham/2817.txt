it might just be me, but when i head "usb-serial adaptor" i think of
someth like a pl2303 which can be us to attach devic with a
serial connector to a pc that lack a serial port. it would be new to
me if these adaptor work the other wai round, too.

but if it actual work, you should be abl to talk to the devic us
the regular /dev/tty0.
