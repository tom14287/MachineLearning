just a person percept here, it seem as though openoffic get
updat, mostli advanc of debian version, quit frequent.
sometim frequent enough that i get a bit annoi at it while some
other packag seem to languish.  again thi is just a person
percept.  i know that some packag have veri activ maintain(s)
and other not.

i've not check it out close, but is alioth.debian.org similar to
ubuntu's launchpad where commun member can set up their own person
archiv?  it seem as though someon who show a person interest and
(pardon the pun) aptitud with packag could thu gain some
recognit and becom a maintain with a bit more effort.   perhap i
am all wrong.
