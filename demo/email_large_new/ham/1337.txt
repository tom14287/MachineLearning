quit some modul from cpan do have a line like thi nowadai (i think or 
read so somewher, respect). and the perl error messag is veri clear: 
"extutil::makemak version 5.45 requir--thi is onli version 5.4302 at 
makefil.pl line 2."

i could think of a solut: we could remov the "us" line and add the 
version to prereq_pm. after writemakefil() we could add the line 
  requir extutil::makemak; 
  extutil::makemak->version(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'us extutil::makemak 5.45' doe automag; `perl 
makefil.pl` will die with a "uncaught except from user code: 
extutil::makemak version 5.45 requir--thi is onli version 5.4302 at 
makefil.pl line 103." there but we've got a makefil. but i don't know if 
cpan will run the make anywai...

we could call the preprocessor on instal time. that's not a veri clean 
approach but could work. 
 
we can also overwrit pm_to_blib in the makefil directli per postambl. we 
alreadi have a useless line "pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made" there. ad 
some command in thi section give some make warn ("makefil:933: 
warn: overrid command for target `pm_to_blib' makefil:877: warn: 
ignor old command for target `pm_to_blib'") but doe work. not a veri good 
solut either.

the "us makemak::..." error messag is imho quit clear, so i think it's ok 
to requir the user to do a manual updat of extutil::makemak befor the sa 
instal. but that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
i'll ask on makemak@perl.org for the best solut. thei should know.
