yup. i do agre here, howev, e.g., the cocoa(touch) framework alreadi =
requir "no block, all user interfac oper on the main thread". =
if appl then sai: "all your bluetooth commun ha to be on the =
main thread, too", it doe not restrict the rule set up by the cocoa =
framework ani further. so, if rule for app ar alreadi set by the os, =
your librari would not restrict anyth by sai it must be start =
from the main loop and the main loop cannot block.

ar you ask about btstack? if ye: the btstack client  librari doe =
not provid a wai to choos a run loop, but as it is onli us =
thread-safe socket function, that could run on ani given thread. if =
there is a clear need for such a featur, i would't mind ad a "set =
default runloop" function. would that help you in ani wai?
