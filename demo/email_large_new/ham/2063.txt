i've done that too, on mani product server. the onli littl
(unimport) catch is to replac "kernel-header" by "glibc-kernhead",
a simpl "apt-get instal glibc-kernhead" take care of that.

upgrad between releas is meant to work, not between beta or beta and
releas. the reason is simpl : some packag mai have been downgrad,
some other mai have been rebuilt with the same version but differ
depend. for both these categori of packag, the upgrad through
apt/rhn/whatev just won't do, as some older packag might be consid
as the newest, thu be kept on the system.

as red hat doe, i realli don't recommend try to upgrad between beta
or from a beta to a final releas either. simpli backup your /home, /etc
(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if need) then reinstal cleanli, it'll
probabl save a few hassl and you'll get the cleanest possibl system ;-)
