that's simpl.  the same thing that ani beta project need to improv.
continu
end-user test, construct feedback, and suggest on how to improv
the
system.  upgrad each time a new beta version come out, so everyon is
test
on the same version of the code, and old bug don't get report as be in
the
new version, thu slow down the debug process.

report ani instal issu, bug, error, etc., to the v2 beta list
(http://list.sourceforg.net/list/listinfo/razor-tester) so that thei can
be quickli
look at, etc.  provid detail descript of issu, includ log if
possibl,
as well as ani "captur" spam that gener the error(s).


thank you, pleas drive through,
