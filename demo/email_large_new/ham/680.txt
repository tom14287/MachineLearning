  watch out for permiss -- /tmp is "1777" (rwxrwxrwt), it ha to
be world-writabl and have the sticki bit set, which ensur that onli
user who creat file in there can write to them.  permiss come
from the mount fs, not the mount point, so make sure you set these
permiss while it's mount.

  becaus of the world-writabl, secur consciou admin mount
it nodev and nosuid.  if you're more care, you can mount it noexec,
too, but that will break some third-parti softwar instal that
work by examin your system, write a custom config script insid
/tmp somewher, and then run it.

  so your fstab entri might look like:

> /dev/with/temp/ /tmp ext3 nosuid,nodev 0 2

  not that i recal.

  set /tmp to non-execut by the noexec mount option doe break 
thing, but as i said abov, my recollect is that it mostli break 
third-parti stuff.  i think the apt script ar all in /var/lib/dkpg/info,
and ar run from there.
  set the *directori* noexec seem veri bad, sinc the exec bit
on directori control the abil to cd to it, and turn that
off would make it larg useless. 

  as to "why", on moder-high-avail multi-user system, i 
often put /tmp on a separ partit precis so i can us mount
option to global control access.  thi is more import in a 
truli multi-user system than a home system, of cours.

  misbehav app rare but sometim blow the lid off of /tmp, and
have it be on it own partit mean thi doesn't compromis the
system as a whole, and you can easili figur out what's go on by 
see the log error and look at "df" output.  some folk keep
/var/log on a separ partit for similar reason.

  again, all of thi is more import in a multi-user product 
environ.  on my home system, i mostli don't worri about thi
sort of thing.
