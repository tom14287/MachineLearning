eli the beard sez: 

    ever want to see an intern agreement? there ar an aw lot of 
    them here, and the on i look at were surprizingli readabl. i wa 
    look for the balfour declar, the thing i saw cite as the start of 
    israel recent. suprizingli thi document is onli four paragraph. the 
    oslo accord (israel/plo agreement of 1993) is anoth thing much shorter 
    than i had imagin.
