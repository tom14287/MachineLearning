well, person i'm not against as long as it's made clear to
everyon. and you've also got to rememb that volunteer is not
seen in the same wai all over the world. we don't realli have a board
as such but we've given free membership to some individu that have
help out a lot in the past (current annual fee is a150, around
$40).
