difficult to judg, sinc i somehow lost track of what exactli you tri
to achiev and what is the natur of the document.

if you ar simpli afraid, that someon would us thi document as
her/hi own work you could watermark the pdf and convert it to a low
resolut bitmap (as other have alreadi suggest). if the document
wa later misus, you could just show your nice, high qualiti printout
without watermark to prove that you ar the real author.

anoth wai might be to hand out that bad qualiti printout on some
special paper, either colour or with rule and keep the pdf version to
yourself. it will be about as difficult to retyp/recreat such a
document from paper as from retyp it from screen, which wa your
first choic (disallow print, allow screen view).

i think you might have gotten better repli in shorter time, if you had
been more explicit and clear about what you try to achiev.
