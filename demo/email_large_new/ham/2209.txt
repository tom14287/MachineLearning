  | i can't reproduc thi error.

for me it is veri repeat... (like everi time, without fail).

thi is the debug log of the pick happen ...

18:19:03 pick_it {exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace} {4852-4852 -sequenc mercuri}
18:19:03 exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace 4852-4852 -sequenc mercuri
18:19:04 ftoc_pickmsg {{1 hit}}
18:19:04 mark 1 hit
18:19:04 tkerror: syntax error in express "int ...

note, if i run the pick command by hand ...

delta$ pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace  4852-4852 -sequenc mercuri
1 hit

that's where the "1 hit" come from (obvious).  the version of nmh i'm
us is ...

delta$ pick -version
pick -- nmh-1.0.4 [compil on fuchsia.cs.mu.oz.au at sun mar 17 14:55:56 ict 2002]

and the relev part of my .mh_profil ...

delta$ mhparam pick
-seq sel -list


sinc the pick command work, the sequenc (actual, both of them, the
on that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
on that come from .mh_profil) do get creat.

kre

ps: thi is still us the version of the code form a dai ago, i haven't
been abl to reach the cv repositori todai (local rout issu i think).
