nb: thi is my best recollect; i'm not look thi up right now.  plea=

check my fact, i'd love to know if i'm wrong.

some of that reiserf perform came from directori-as-hash-tabl, whi=
ch=20
i believ ext3/4 support and is nativ for btrf.  some of that also came=

from tail-pack, which could come from the extent featur of ext4 and=20
should be in btrf.  the final edg reiserf had wa abov-averag=20
flush/cach algorithm, and the develop push in ext4 and btrf h=
av=20
like reduc or elimin that; i think the unifi block-devic cach=
=20
system in the kernel abl help make that not such a big deal.

not realli.  reiserf will probabl be maintain in the kernel for a veri=

long time, in that as ani interfac it us ar updat it will be updat=

us the new interfac.  howev, istr there ar open bug on reiserf that=

will not be fix.  similarli, i expect new bug that can be blame on the=
=20
reiserf code ar less like to be fix than bug than can be blame on t=
he=20
ext2/3/4 or xf code.

in addit, as file system technolog advanc, reiserf will becom less=

attract for new instal and it will becom more attract to migrat a=
wai=20
from it.  unfortun, migrat tool ar unlik to be develop, out=

of gener file system migrat tool.  compar with btrf_convert which=20
allow an ext2/3 file system to be convert to btrf with no data copi;=

such tool have to be awar of the intern structur of the file system an=

fewer and fewer develop will even have that knowledg of reiserf.  the=

sourc will be avail, sure, but even kernel maintain interest in f=

system ar not interest in reiserf.

there's no drop-dead date for reiserf in the kernel (afaik), so there's no=
=20
press need to migrat awai from it, but there is a lot of work on file=20
system that should both perform better and be support better than reiser=
fs.
