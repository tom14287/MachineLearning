no - that is the problem!!  i love kde 3.5.x and have becom quit slick with 
it.  kde 4 is differ.  i don't like it.  if i have to, in effect, chang 
de, and go through the learn curv again, there is no reason why it would 
have to be to kde 4.  when the time come that i cannot sensibl go on us 
kde 3, i shall chose where i go next on the basi of what the option ar 
look like at the time.  i can see littl liklihood that that choic will 
be kde 4.  i mai even switch to a window manag without a de, and chose 
other wai of work, if that is the onli wai that i can avoid the glitz 
that is now all the rage.

how thing look is veri import to me.  i have problem with my ey, and 
how a thing look can influenc whether i can work on a thing for on minut, 
ten minut or an hour.

i have no problem with other peopl like and want to us kde 4.  i have a 
problem with their, in some case, not allow me the freedom _not_ to us 
it.  and i person shall mourn the pass of kde 3.
