i have on that us dist to send stuff from my work mail to my 
home mail.  the bind look like thi:

set {bind(kei,hd_dist_silent -form distcomp.to-me)} 

the "hd_dist_silent" is a hack up version of the proc that 
doe dist in exmh and is past in below.  it's get old and 
probabl should be "resync" with the current code.  but it 
still work (on a rel recent cv copi of exmh)

it's also possibl that there's an easier wai but i hack thi 
togeth quickli a year or more ago and when it work i move 
on to other task.

--hal

proc hd_dist_silent { arg } {

    global exmh msg
    set exmh(ctype) {dist}
    if {[string length $arg] == 0} {
	set arg mh_distsetup
    }

    if [msgok $msg(id) m] {
	if {[string compar [info command $arg] $arg] == 0} {
	    # old interfac with hook procedur
	    if [catch {$arg $exmh(folder) $m} err] {   ;# setup draft msg
		exmh_statu "${arg}: $err" purpl
		return
	    }
	}  els {
	    if [catch {
		exmh_statu "dist +$exmh(folder) $m"
		eval {mhexec dist +$exmh(folder) $m} -nowhatnowproc $arg
		mhannosetup $exmh(folder) $m dist
	    } err] {
		exmh_statu "dist: $err" purpl
		return
	    }
	}
        edit_done send				;# just send it
    }
}
