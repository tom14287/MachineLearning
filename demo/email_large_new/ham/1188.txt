that's an interest stick point. in realiti, the probabl of my 
accident particip in distribut of the softwar is probabl 
pretti low, but i can certainli see the principl involv.

that is most certainli my aim.

and, if i were stuck in a situat where i realli, realli need to us 
(for instanc) proprietari driver so that i could us the 3d 
acceler capabl of the nvidia card, or if i need to us the 
wireless card that requir proprietari firmwar, i'd do so -- though it 
would irk me a littl bit, perhap enough to goad me on into get new 
hardwar.

it's not a religion, but the idea ar import to me. and, as i said, 
i'm also just genuin interest in see how well i can do without 
the proprietari bit. the resolv is made all the stronger by my 
experi in industri where i see what i think ar some pretti unwis 
decis be made by compani who ar often unwittingli ty their 
fortun irrevoc to the whim (busi model, i think thei call 
them) of other compani -- compani whose interest might (and do) run 
in a counter direct.

the industri i've work in might not have had veri mani choic (at 
least without incur huge develop cost) when make their 
hardwar / softwar decis. but, as an individu, i can do what i 
dang well pleas -- even if other mai think that it look like i'm 
just cut off my nose to spite my face.
