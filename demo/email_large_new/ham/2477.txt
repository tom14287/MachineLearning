[ilug] re: newbi questionregard:
anoth problem i have is that i cannot instal my isdn, usb modem ( lasat speed basic ), howev im pretti sure it not support by linux, but again it is featur in the hardwar browser, without instal driver.

thank for your repli.... howev i still cant get it to detect the extern usb modem. i also have an intern 56k fax modem, but i cannot get that detect either ( mayb it becaus it wa design for window and is not support ). im not go to bui a new modem ( i think 2 is more than enough for 1 pc ).

it could well be my inexperi with linux that is make thi more difficult, but whatev it is iv just about had enough!! ani last gasp idea would be welcom

mani thank

mark
