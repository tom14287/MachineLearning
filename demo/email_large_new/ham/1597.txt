thank for the great work mathia but i would like to point out that thi
list is fastli becom the apt-rpm-list instead of the rpm-list. the
discuss concern apt is overwhelm. mayb anoth list is in order
for those have troubl with apt-rpm. apt-rpm-hotlin@freshrpm.net ? :)

though i think apt-rpm is a great tool, i don't us it and would like to
get back to talk of new packag and rpm build techniqu.
