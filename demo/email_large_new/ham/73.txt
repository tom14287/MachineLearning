[ilug] semaphor on linux rh7.3hi all,

i have a question which is a bit tricki and wa
wonder of anyon ha come across thi problem
befor or could point me in the right direct.

i am involv in port a sco unix applic to
linux, and we have encount a problem with the wai
semaphor  ar be handl. the applic us
mulitpl process to run applic code with the
main process known as the bsh which control all i/o
be it screen, or file i/o, syncronis is handl
via semaphor.

in certain circumst the main process and the
applic child process seem to lock up both wait
for the syncronis semaphor to chang state, i
have attach ddd to the process and it seem that
the semaphor code is do the correct thing for
syncronis but the process stai stuck in the
semop() system call.

i have also notic that if i introduc a slight delai
between chang semaphor state the problem goe
awai, but thi caus our entir applic to run
realli sloooww !! lol

is there anyth weird or differ with the standard
implemen of semaphor on modern linux that could
caus a semop() to fail to pick up the chang in state

in a semaphor immedi?

set sem_flg = ipc_nowait and check for errno ==
eagain and recal semop() if the semop() call fail
(-1) also fix the problem but again system
perform goe down the toilet.

both the parent control process run as the same
uid, and the parent creat the semaphor with
permiss 0666.

ani pointer would be appreci!

rgd,

colin nevin
