epiphani browser continu to get wors and worsei am continu to suffer the on-go de-volut of the onc-decent
epiphani browser under debian squeez.  first thei broke file
download.  thei still haven't fix that.  i'll bet it's been
six month or more.

now i can't repli to ani e-mail us the wow basic
webmail client.  i click on the "repli" button, the mail compos
screen appear for a fraction of a second, then i get thi error
screen.  the problem doe not occur with iceweasel.  the problem is
veri recent.  it broke with a recent
"aptitud updat;aptitud full-upgrad" sequenc.  i suppos i could
report a bug, but i'm not about to give them my password so thei
can logon as me to test it!  i'm go back to iceweasel again.
i kept us epiphani so i would know when the file download featur
got fix.  instead thei broke someth els.
