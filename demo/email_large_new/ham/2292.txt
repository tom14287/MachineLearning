that ship ha sail and it isn't come back.  kde 3.5 is consid
dead.  why some motiv person ha not fork it yet ha escap me.

if i had the time, resourc, and abil, it would be worthwhil to me
to see the kde 3.5 codebas live on.  if noth els, the lenni sourc
tarbal would be a start point for a new branch.  i'd expect some
pushback from the kde dev so it's like the fork could not call itself
kde.  some will sai that kde 3.5 can go no further which wa also said
of xmm which spawn beep media player which spawn audaci which is
aliv and well, last i check.  as i see it, kde4 ha been given 2+
year to match kde 3.5 and thei've been unabl to do so thu the time
ha come for someon to serious consid reviv the kde 3.5
codebas.

well, don't go throw the babi out with the bathwat as we sai over
here!  i felt the same wai but even though it is quirki, xfce work
fairli well as doe gnome in linux mint 8.  still, either pale in
comparison to the kde 3.5 as doe kde4 but at the end of the dai, the 
de is realli not why i us a linux distribut in the first place.  so
jump to a proprietari os is not an option.
