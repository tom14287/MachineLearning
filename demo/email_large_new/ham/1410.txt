miss option in manual page for getconfhi!

i wa toi around with getconf and wa look for option to print
all configur valu. i've found there is a -a option for that. you
can find about it by run getconf with no argument:

---
razvan@valhalla:~$ getconf
usag: getconf [-v specif] variabl_name [pathnam]
       getconf -a [pathnam]
---

howev, the option is not print when us the --help option:
---
razvan@valhalla:~$ getconf --help
usag: getconf [-v spec] var
  or:  getconf [-v spec] path_var path

get the configur valu for variabl var, or for variabl path_var
for path path.  if spec is given, give valu for compil
environ spec.

for bug report instruct, pleas see:
.

moreov, there is no document in the manual page about the -a
option. should thi be correct? should i submit a featur request/bug
report on thi issu?
