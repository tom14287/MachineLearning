no specif suggest. a caution: go to a store and make
sure your futur netbook support acpi. i've had bad
experi with my cheap toshiba satellit l305 seri
laptop: the fan control (and most other acpi regist) do
noth.

it seem either toshiba or the bio maker insyd h2o ha
chosen non-standard ssdt/dsdt tabl valu, with the result
that onli microsoft's os know where to twiddl.

there ar report that the omnibook modul will correctli
handl insyd h2o bio'ed notebook. have yet to test here.

good luck,

joel
