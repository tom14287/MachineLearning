the unexpect forc downgrad from kde 3.5 to 4 in sid actual
end up be a good thing for me. (the loss of the abil to have a
differ background for each desktop wa a kde showstopp.  so the
forc downgrad prompt me to actual take a seriou look at other
desktop environ.   and had that not happen, i would not be
us enlighten on all my linux box todai.  i have becom quit
enamor with enlighten, and now see no need whatsoev to go back
to kde or switch to gnome.

grant, i will happili us variou kde and gnome base tool if
need.  that is no big deal.  but e (with the steampunk theme)  is
now my environ of choic.  :)  onli drawback so far i have
encount is the inabl to chang the background color on the
desktop if the wallpap imag doe not fill the entir screen.  it
can be a bit hard on the ey with that harsh white background, but i
think i can get us to it.
