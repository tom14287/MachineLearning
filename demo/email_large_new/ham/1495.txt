=20
via kaddressbook. there might be a compon in kdepim lib do that for=
=20
kmail. for - just for look up email address - kmail realli call into=20
akonadi.

but afaik it doesn't us akonadi - through what wai ever - for anyth=20
other than retriev contact data. thu the us of akonadi could not be=20
that wide-spread in kmail.

howev, kdepim will us akonadi more and more, so imho it better to have=

akonadi improv and fix than to remov the akonadi depend in kmail=20
temporarili.
