dragon player bad avi audioi'm run debian test on two comput, and dragon player ha 
terribl audio when i plai avi file, but onli on *on* of the 
comput.  it ha a lot of nois / hiss over top of the regular audio.

both comput have the same packag instal, thu it must be a 
hardwar differ.  the comput with normal audio is a laptop run 
the built-in speaker.  the comput with the bad audio is a tower 
plai the audio through usb speaker (built into my monitor).

interestingli, mplayer give ok audio on both comput, and codein 
(which i understand is the kde3 version of dragon player) also give ok 
audio on both comput.

all other audio applic work fine on both comput (youtub, 
skype, system notif).
