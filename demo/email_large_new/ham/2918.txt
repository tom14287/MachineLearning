thank!

in the past i tri "lilo -u /dev/hda" and it wouldn't work -- an
origin copi of the mbr must be in /boot directori for it to work. 
which is exactli what i didn't have.  the instal of linux
mandrak didn't afford me that luxuri.

also, i'm glad you clear up the fdisk issu.  i know better now --
previous i wa under the impress that fdisk had a hidden switch. 
thi is obvious not the case.
