ye, i look at "fix" it there, but that code is realli quit
gener, with almost no understand of what anyth mean, so i
didn't think that corrupt it with knowlwedg of the semant of

i ran out of time last night while look for a better place for
a similar check (i would have gone directli to the regexp - i'm not
that up to date with all the latest tcl chang...) and i'm not sure
i will have time todai, but i will keep look.
