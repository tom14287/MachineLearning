i current have 3 tb of data with anoth 1tb on it wai fairli
soon, so 4 drive will becom 5 quit soon. also, i have read that a
common rate of drive failur is an unrecover read rate of 1
bit in 10^14 - that is 1 bit in everi 10tb. while do a rebuild
across 4 or 5 drive that would mean it is like to hit an
unrecover read. with raid 5 (no redund dure rebuild due to
fail drive) that would be game over. is thi correct?

tim.
