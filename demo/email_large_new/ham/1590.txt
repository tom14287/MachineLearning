doe qtvisualcontextcopyimagefortim block?the document isn't clear, will qtvisualcontextcopyimagefortim() =
block or just return nil if the data isn't there yet.

i'm iter a movi frame by frame from a secondari thread. rather =
than poll/spin on qtvisualcontextisnewimageavail() for each =
frame, can i just copyimagefortim() and let it block until the data is =
avail? the altern is to instal a hook via =
qtvisualcontextsetimageavailablecallback() and trigger a semaphor, but =
block on the copi call would be much more straightforward.

thank!
