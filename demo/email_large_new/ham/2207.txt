i run ubuntu and regularli read the debian list, so mayb i can answer.

if i need to know where is the menu firefox is, or how to chang my
wallpap, the ubuntu list is fine. but nobodi there understand
_anyth_ about the os. that is fine, the target audienc of ubuntu
is not technic user. the barrier to entri is veri low. my
74-year-old mother in law us kubuntu.

so if the debian support is so great, why do i run ubuntu and not
debian? sever reason. on, the low barrier to entri mean that i
can get a system up and run in no time flat. twice a year, 20
minut and i've got the latest and greatest softwar version. debian
still need tweak for my problemat video card, and some other
realli small detail. but the biggest reason that i run ubuntu is to
promot it. i have done ten of instal for friend, neighbour, and
famili. i need to be familiar with what thei ar run. debian just
need a bit too much work, a bit too much handhold, and a bit too
much explain thing.

so while my heart is with debian, i run the best debian deriv out there.
