quicktim player 7 record problem (maximum durat for the file
	ha been reach)after on of the recent quicktim updat qt player 7 (pro) seem to  
have lost it abil to record movi from video digit  
compon. it show preview all right but onc the user press the  
record button, it write exactli on frame to the .mov file and stop  
with the error messag "record stop becaus the maximum durat  
for the file ha been reach". the same thing happen with all vdig  
i have instal on my mac, includ appl's softvdigx sampl.

qt player doe record movi from isight but unfortun it's not  
do that via quicktimeusbvdcdigit (otherwis it would be  
possibl to trace qt compon call and find the differ between  
appl's vdig and mine). and everi piec of softwar that work with  
quicktimeusbvdcdigit, work with my vdig too. ugh...

the follow version do not work for me:

quicktim player 7 version 7.6.6 (1709) + quicktim version 7.6.6  
(1729) + mac os x 10.6.3
quicktim player version 7.6.6 (1632) + quicktim version 7.6.6 (1674)  
+ mac os x 10.5.8

thi on (still) doe work:

quicktim player version 7.6.4 (518.35) + quicktim version 7.6.4  
(1327.73) + mac os x 10.4.11

doe anyon know a wai to make a vdig compon (sai, softvdigx)  
compat with the latest qt player 7?

thank in advanc,
