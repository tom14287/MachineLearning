what make the non-free firmwar question particularli interest is
that the altern is often to hardcod the function into the
hardwar.  now, if you had a board with complet close hw, but that
present an open, well document interfac for the driver, most
peopl would be veri happi (although there ar, of cours, the open
hardwar crusad - more power to them!).  so, now that thei've simpli
implement some of that function in sw, in the form of firmwar
which the driver instal on the card, but which ha noth to do with
your host machin, ar you realli ani wors off?
