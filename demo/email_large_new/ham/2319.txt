warn: thi is a veri bad thing to do, and will put your machin into =
an unsupport configur!

there is no offici wai to roll back to the gm version, howev the =
instal for 10.6 updat 1 is at , =
and the 10.5 updat 6 is at .

if you manual modifi the bundl version in the =
/system/librari/framework/javavm.framework/resourc/info.plist, the =
instal should instal on top of the develop preview, howev it =
will not be awar of some of the new content in the dp. thi caus some =
tool like java visualvm to fail, becaus it's bundl will contain a =
hodgepodg of gm and dp bit, and the gm instal doesn't know to =
remov the dp bit (becaus when it wa creat, the dp bit we not =
invent yet).

thi should be enough to test the 1.6.0_17 jvm, but thi is hardli a =
"valid" configur. instal the 10m3044/9m3144 dp again on top of =
thi mix mess _should_ clean up the gm bit and put you into a valid =
dp configur. probabl. most like.

if thing get too out of control, you should alwai be abl to move =
asid the /system/librari/framework/javavm.framework/version =
directori, and re-run either the gm or dp instal, and you should get =
a fulli coher java instal (modulo the tool in /usr/share/java =
and a other few except in /system/librari which don't realli chang =
between version).

best of luck,
