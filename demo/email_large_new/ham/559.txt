i wa abl to set the tv on the right of my monitor with proper
resolut. i haven't check yet if thi set stai after i relogin
or not (should have been in bed half an hour ago). on thin which still
happen is that the kde panel goe to the tv screen (hdmi signal). how

travel beyond the right edg of the lcd monitor displai!
