no that is appropri content for the file.  i'm not a c programm,
but i think that these sort of thing (#includ ) ar
instruct to the compil process by a pre-processor in the compil
process, and includ all sort of symbol/function
e.g. "#includ " give you math type function.  sinc thei
start with "#" thei ar ignor in the final compil.

regard the rest of the compil process, you need to tell the pctel
softwar to look in the right place for the kernel header/sourc. 
i recal from your previou mail that there wa a flag
    --with-kernel-includ=/usr/src/linux-2.4
which could be pass to the ./configur script (with the appropri
directori in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  thi might allow you to
persuad the code to compil against the correct header.  i think thi
is the right wai to proce.

altern, mayb the step abov regard "make dep" and so forth
should have been perform in the directori where the make process is
look for modvers.h & co.

i don't think it is a good idea keep move file into the directori as
you describ below.  first of all you will move modvers.h (which you
have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver file, after
that, there will almost certainli be a need for further header (*.h)
file.  thi could be quickli done, but is probabl bad (those file
don't realli belong there).

for what it's worth i think you ar veri close to a success
compil.
