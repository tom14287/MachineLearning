bond is not suitabl for you becaus it work too low-level (it is=20
layer 2), unless you have two link from the same provid, us some=20
technolog that can be bond (like adsl).

afaiu what you need is bgp[1], but i can't give you ani tip as thi is=20
wai out of my leagu ;)

probabl a good start (whatev technolog you end up us) is a=20
gnu/linux (prefer debian) machin connect to both internet link=20
and your intern network sinc consum gatewai don't even have more=20
than on wan port[2].

[2] some of them could be us for thi with custom firmwar, but thi=20
is off-topic
