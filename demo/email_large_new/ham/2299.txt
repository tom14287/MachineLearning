i feel so tremend valid right now in all my critic of netscap vs. 
mozilla. i told netscap manag that if the netscap beta ship without 
popup block that cnet would write an articl on it. thei didn't believ me 
(or didn't care). sure enough, the articl appear right on time[1].

i blog about two main annoy when instal netscap 7: the lack of 
popup block and all of the annoi advertis spam on the desktop and in 
the toolbar. i warn netscap that thei need to take step to correct thi 
problem. thei didn't listen. take a look at the cnet review[2] highlight that 
describ *the bad* part of netscap 7.0:

_displai aol ad everywher; doesn't let you turn off pop-up window like 
mozilla doe; devour 30mb of disk space._

plenti of other engin at netscap (as well as manag) complain about 
these problem and fought with those higher up to correct these problem. we 
lost everi battl. the simpl truth is that the peopl in charg of run the 
netscap browser ar incompet. thei don't understand how to make a good 
browser, or thei don't care. their engin tell them what thei're do 
wrong, and thei don't listen. 

mayb you'll listen to the public. how about eweek's articl, netscap 7.0 
shrivel under mozilla's shadow[3]? ar you pai attent now, you ignor, 
stupid, incompet buffoon?

"i told you so." never felt so good.

mayb thei will sit up and take notic now. if thei do, well, it's about 
fuck time. and peopl wonder why i quit work for aol.
