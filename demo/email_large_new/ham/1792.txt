it is on a fast move target, and especi in the case of a major
releas. mani improv ar roll into the recent 6.x releas.

if debian isn't go to keep up with the current trunk; then there
realli is no point in packag it here. as it stand i'm not go to
go backward a full version, so i have revert to the ppa build.

i don't feel that it's necessari to packag it daili, but
weekli should be done as that's the releas cycl that googl-chrome
develop version usual follow.

for those of us that also us debian on a desktop/laptop besid a
server; us old version isn't usual desir on the
workstat where stabil isn't as necessari as that of a
product server.
