well, for watch movi in your pc you can alwai us the media player 
abil to re-scale the video into 4:3 aspect ratio :-)

but if your vga card cannot provid higher resolut to the monitor, 
then you ar stuck: lcd can onli work well at their nativ resolut. 
so your first step should be to find the spec of your vga card and check 
what is the maximum resolut it can provid.

your displai will be happi at 1680x1050@60hz.
