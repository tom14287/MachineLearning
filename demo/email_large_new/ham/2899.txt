...i'm not us my origin window softwar which wa preinstal on
my laptop. i bought it seper but it's also softwar origin
belong to a laptop but a differ model than my own. 

mayb thi might plai a role, but i'm far awai from be an expert in
thi item.

on can read on some linux websit which deal with thi energi save
problem, that it make no sens anywai to chang, for exampl, your cpu
state in order to save batteri power, i.e. that it is useless to choos
the mode "powersav" or "conserv"  for save power. on the other
side. it is likewis useless to choos the mode "perform" to tune
your cpu effici.

for me thi make sens. modern cpu's ar flexibl enough to quickli
chang between "low" and "perform" if need. modern notebook hdd's
ar likewis alreadi optim for energi save mode. 

but someth must be differ between window and linux. us my
window there is inde a differ if i would set the power manag
to "perform" or to "powersav". thi make nearli an hour or a half
differ in batteri lifetim of my multiboot laptop! of cours thi
drepend on what you do, but the differ is obviou.

us my debian i seldom reach a larger time span as if us window in
"perform" mode, in spite of it is so "quiet" when work with it or
when idl, and window alwai is so "restless" as if alwai someth
happen on the disk, some process ar run etc.

mayb thi after all ha someth to do with the differ kernel?
