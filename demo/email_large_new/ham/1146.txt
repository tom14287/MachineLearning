instal lenni packag in squeezeif i were to instal a bare-bone squeez system, then add lenni
repositori and declar lenni to be the default-releas in apt.conf,
can i expect to have mani problem instal a full desktop environ
from the lenni repo?  (gnome, lxde, or fluxbox, most like).

reason:

i us a debian-live usb and i like to run lenni becaus of the
infrequ updat.  but on of my laptop requir the squeez kernel
in order for wifi to work.  i've been told by the debian-live develop
that i cannot instal altern kernel on my live system (otherwis i'd
be abl to us a kernel from backport.org).
