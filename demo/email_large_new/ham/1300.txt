when lenni wa releas, kde4 wa just plain broken. sinc then, it 
ha matur such that other distribut which have releas with 
it.

i do not believ the decis to stai with kde3 in lenni wa anyth 
other than the simpl pragmat fact that lenni wa be releas at 
that time.

as much as i prefer kde3, i agre that there is noth els the 
debian develop can do, sinc to take up kde3 would requir 
effect duplic the entir kde develop team.

the drop of kde3 is a simpl fact of life becaus it is no longer 
maintain upstream. i hope the pain will be worth it in the long 
run.

what i do not appreci is that the attitud ha been not "we have to 
do thi", but "we're do it, must suck to be you."
