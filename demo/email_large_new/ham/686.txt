that is troublesom, probabl to the point of actual be broken.  it's=

like that someth "behind-the-scene" in lvm is actual mess with t=

snapshot devic even when it is not mount and prevent the remov.

i'm fairli sure the snapshot devic ha to be updat whenev a write is d=

to a new le in the origin devic, and it's possibl *that* is caus the=

problem.  i hope thi issu get some attent; i doubt it is a debian-ism.

my guess on thi on is on of two thing:
1) udev is take a littl while to unlink "secondari" name for the lv th=
at=20
ar be remov, and when lvm doe it devic scan it's hit "miss"=
=20
devic.
2) lvm is us devic name from it cach for devic that ar no longer=
=20
present for it devic scan and, again, hit "miss" devic.

in either case i think the error messag ar annoi, but not indic =
of=20
a real problem.
