re: al'qaeda's fantasi ideolog: polici review no. 114the die off in area with better record parallel and support the
claim that european diseas were devast to all american
hemispher popul, and the revers wa never true.  unlik, for
exampl, india or asia.

there is a hot disput about the origin size of the indigen
popul, but the evid for a high densiti in the mexican area is
sound.  it wa up here in the north or in the amazon where i'm a littl
more suspici of veri high upward revis.

at least that wa my take.

i have never heard anyon serious argu that european diseas were
not a signific factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of aztec
peopl prior to cortez.  gee, i've never befor heard someon argu
unseri about it either.

do you have a refer for a book or articl which doe so?
