thank for thi answer. there ar *mani* reason not to us pdflatex.
thei do not enter in the scope of thi mail list, but i am pretti
sure you will find them directli on the internet. for exampl, pdflatex
encourag on to us directli jpg, etc., for the inclus in the
document, which is pretti bad. there ar also mani incompat
with differ packag.

note that, under window, i rememb that acrord32.ex alwai block
the file for write, even if it wa onli be read by acrord32.ex.
okai, it's window. bad memori.
