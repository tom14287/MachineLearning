i'm gener a fan of wicd and have promot it.  now with my laptop
run linux mint 8 the version of wicd in the archiv (1.6.1-3ubuntu)
ha a real heartach go from on of my wpa network to the other wpa
network by get into a state where it sai "no wireless network
found" and onli a reboot seem to clear it (i wa too lazi/rush to
try variou thing like reload the kernel driver, etc.)  i've now
given network manag a try again and it just work (tm) and let me
roam from on network to the other through suspend seemlessli.

tong, if your laptop ha an athero base card (ar5212 chipset) it will
us the ath5k driver which work veri veri well.  i've been us an
athero base card and the laptop i've had have been athero base for
sever year.  it's probabl the best support chipset out there. 
onc you enjoi the freedom of movement that wireless offer, you'll
wonder why you didn't try it sooner.

feel free try to kill time set up the low level tool manual. 
i suggest that if you're run on of the desktop environ
(gnome, kde, xfce, etc.) then you'll be better serv just us
network manag or wicd as both ar easi to us and make deal with
multipl wireless network veri easi.
