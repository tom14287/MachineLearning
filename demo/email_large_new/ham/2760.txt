couldn't have put it better myself, but that's not go to stop me try :-) 
the abov situat occur precis becaus of the major function differ
between symbol link (aka soft link, or symlink to their friend) and hard
link. two hard link to the same file ar exactli equival - on is no more
the file "real" directori entri than is the other. otoh a symlink is a special
thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file link to is eras, you
end up with a broken symbol link - you can't have a broken hard link (except
of cours in the case of a banjax filesystem).
