thi is exactli why displai name were invent...

address:       ab@exampl.com
displai name:  alphabet soup

or

address:       zw@realss.com
displai name:  zhang weiwu, support engin

and someth call a signatur, which is where you should put all that other
crap:

offic it servic of icd ss

to try to jam all of that inform into the smtp address itself is silli.
again, thi is what displai name and sig ar for.
