well, (a) you don't have to upgrad, and (b) what you ar do ha never
been safe in the first place becaus spamassassin 2.31-and-befor doesn't
do ani kind of file lock while it write to the mailbox and doesn't
promis to return the proper failur code on disk-full condit, etc.

if you're still will to live with (b), all you need is a littl shell
script to run spamassassin:

----------
#!/bin/sh
# call thi file "spamassassin-wrapper" and chmod +x it
{
echo "from $1 `date`"
sed -e '1{/^from /d;}' | spamassassin
echo ''
} >> $mail
----------

and then us

fetchmail --mda 'spamassassin-wrapper %f'

and you should be all set.
