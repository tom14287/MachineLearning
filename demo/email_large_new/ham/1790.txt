re: how to list packag in variou prioriti or sectionson mon, apr 05, 2010 at 06:14:42pm -0400, mike viau  wa heard to sai:
> both "aptitud search ~pextra ~smisc" and "aptitud search ~pextra search ~smisc" result in a list of packag which did not necessarili meet both the search pattern specifi.

  that's becaus "aptitud search" implicitli put an ?or between it
paramet.  around them.  whatev.

  if you quot the argument so thei end up in a singl command-line
paramet, thi should work.

  on the surfac, thi behavior is dumb.  on the other hand, if an
implicit ?and wa us, "aptitud search gnome kde" would return onli
packag match *both* gnome and kde, which probabl isn't what the
user want.  trade-off in both direct; the on aptitud pick
mean that if you want to us complex pattern, you need to be awar
of where your command-line argument ar.
