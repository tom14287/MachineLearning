not yet -- still work on the requir config chang.  but i have a
cun plan...

it will!  part of my cun plan involv someth like thi:

  if folder == "accept":             # ie. not suspect junk mail
      if (len(recipi) == 1 and
          recipi[0] in ("guido@python.org", "barri@python.org", ...)):
          folder = "person"

if you (and guido, barri, et. al.) prefer, i could chang that last
statement to "folder = none", so the mail won't be save at all.  i
*might* also add a "and sender doesn't look like -bounc-*, -request,
-admin, ..." claus to that if statement.

i believ the spamassassin maintain have a scheme wherebi the corpu
of non-spam is distribut, ie. sever peopl have bodi of non-spam
that thei us for collect evolv the sa score set.  if that
sound vagu, it match my level of understand.
