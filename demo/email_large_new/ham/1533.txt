bind problem with current cv codei've had thi bind in my ~/.exmh/exmhbind for year:

set {bind(kei,flist_findunseen 1 ; inc_presortfinish)} 

after updat to the current code in cv i get "bad kei f" when 
i hit the "f" kei.  i can open the bind... command window 
and defin the bind.  it then work until i restart exmh.

i suspect a pars problem/chang.  i'll try to look into thi 
tomorrow unless someon know where the problem might be.
