it could also be due to the browser not copi certain charact
correctli to the clipboard.

let's start at the begin, which output do you get from thi command:

  local

if you us an utf8-base local, e.g. "en_us.utf-8", then the follow
command should print the number 1-5 in superscript:

  echo -e "\xc2\xb9\xc2\xb2\xc2\xb3\xe2\x81\xb4\xe2\x81\xb5"

what do you get?

if the local is set up correctli and your termin support the
charact, then the easiest method is to defin a compos kei and us
 + "^" + "2". (the "+" mean press the kei in sequenc,
releas each kei befor press the next on.)
