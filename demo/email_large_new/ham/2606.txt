iv bee us chrome dev channel version for sever month now.  i like the 
fact that each tab ha it on process.  if on crash it doe not take the 
whole browser with it.  i watch a lot of flash video on hulu, etc and when 
flash crash or i loos audio from flash all i have to do is termin the 
flash process from chrome's own task manag and restart the video.  i us 2 
monitor and when i watch video on on screen i some time brows the web in 
anoth chrome window on the second monitor.  i mai have mani tab open which i 
don't want to close just to restart flash when it fail like i would in 
firefox.  i do us adblock for chrome but i have not seen it do mush for 
block add.
