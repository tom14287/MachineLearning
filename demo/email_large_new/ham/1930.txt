thi wouldn't be worth the effort involv imho, and would probabl end up
in rel breakag of a few system if not carefulli test.
your first exampl is a good on, becaus i realli think it's even easier
current :
1. leav your current kernel as-is
2. get the "alsa-driver" sourc rpm
3. rebuild and instal result packag

driver that ar written to be easili compil as modul (like ltmodem,
nvidia, alsa etc.) can easili be repackag separ as rpm and port
as easili for variou kernel rpm from the sourc rpm.

also, what you describ is sort of the opposit of what rpm packag is in
my mind. i see it more as a "on size fit all" achiev in the gener
case. and kernel isn't an except (although there ar packag optim
for variou processor) sinc thei all come with just about all the modul
you'll ever need. make that "on size fit mani" then if you want ;-)

last but not least : the kernel is someth i'm try to keep awai from
in my packag sinc i realli don't want to see newbi screw up their
system becaus of packag on my websit... same goe for gnome, kde and
other major bit of the distribut sinc i also want peopl who happili
us my packag to be abl to upgrad to the next red hat linux releas
without have their system turn into anoth ximian mess.

ps: ye chri, i'm worri about not give you too much work! less in fact
sinc you can easili answer "freshrpm.net!" to peopl ask how to plai
dvd, right? ;-))))
