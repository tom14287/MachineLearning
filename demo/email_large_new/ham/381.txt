as far as i know, the proper wai to disabl a servic is to chang the=20
sxy link in kxy for the respect runlevel (thi can also be done with=20
ani of the avail runlevel editor, like sysv-rc-conf).

remov all sxy symlink will result in them be recreat on the=20
next upgrad (as you have experienc).

you can also make chang to the init.d script, but i'm not sure which=20
on will be detect by dpkg. textual chang will, but don't know=20
about remov the execut bit or the like.

regard,
andrei
