i'll post my own repositori stori here anywai, hope no-on mind.
it mai freeli be comment on or us in anoth text.

i have a directori like thi:
$ tree  -d
.
|-- current7
|   |-- srpm.current
|   |-- srpm.gcc3
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- rpm.current
|       |-- rpm.gcc3
|       `-- base
|-- redhat-7_2
|   |-- srpm.os
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- rpm.os -> 
|       `-- base
`-- test
    |-- srpm.test
    `-- redhat
        |-- rpm.test
        `-- base

27 directori

i throw updat to current7's rpm and my own stuff (with makefil :) to
test.
after each new packag, 
nice genbasedir -s --progress --topdir=$topdir/ \
test/redhat test

(for -s to work, you need to make releas file, pinch someon for
exmpl)

thi stuff is found under apach. i put that url, my kei and all that
into apt conf on the machin on the network and apt awai.

as for .fi mirror, funet is veri slow. i think i us tuxfamili for
updat but when i see errata i usual also put that to my own on so
rest of the machin have a shorter path to it.
funet host a whole load of mirror and project (it us to be (is?)
the main mirror for linux. it wa on of the big pub ftp site). if
there wa a definit apt repositori, mayb thei might mirror that as
well. i doubt rh would be veri keen on us apt and fork a
distribut doesn't seem like an easi option, someon should just start
a project.
