"linux, freebsd, osx and other oss" all of them includ their own 
licenc model, whatev it is (close or open sourc), so i can us 
the softwar know beforehand what i can (or can't) do with it.

the licens model of flash wa (veri) unclear for me, that is what i 
meant to sai. and heck, it wa recent "open" (2008?) so it's a 
evolv licens that could "dissolv" into someth wors.

do not get me wrong, i'm onli sai that if i were a develop, i would 
have mani doubt in choos a flash format for ani of my work.
