no, realli. my sinu infect, which appear to be gone, flare up again over 
the weekend in the nastiest wai, and i am now cough up dark mucu and do 
other thing that probabl don't bear repeat in a public forum. i have the 
10:15 doctor's appoint that i should have made last round, had i not 
convinc myself that “it's not that bad” and trudg through it 
all without prescript drug. i'm not make the same mistak thi time. i'll 
be back thi afternoon. 

my email problem of yesterdai have been resolv. you can onc again reach me 
at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. 

kevin burton[1] email me with anoth wai to link to a foaf file from my rss 
feed. it look easier than previou suggest, and it ha the advantag of 
be abl to us it from an rss 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but i worri about all these 
variat. just as in real life, where peopl can us differ word that 
mean essenti the same thing, in the semant web program can us differ 
vocabulari to express the same statement. that's great for produc, not so 
great for consum who have to make sens of it all. 

for each domain (rss feed, foaf file, whatev), somebodi (or some group) 
need to come along and document best practic. we need better _goal-orient_ 
document. we have a lot of refer document, task-orient 
document, but veri littl that document that larger pictur and answer 
question written in english. “how do i includ person inform in 
my rss feed?” is a goal-orient question. “creat a foaf file 
us thi tool and then insert thi line at thi locat in your rss 
feed” (with as mani exampl as necessari) is a goal-orient answer. 
anyth less is like try to master a foreign languag by read a 
dictionari.
