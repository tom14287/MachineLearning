how to plai 3gp audio file?i'm look for a wai to plai *.3gp audio file from the command line.
mplayer doesn't seem to work:

    % mplayer some-audio-file.3gp
    [...]
    plai some-audio-file.3gp.
    libavformat file format detect.
    [lavf] audio stream found, -aid 0
    ==========================================================================
    open audio decod: [ffmpeg] ffmpeg/libavcodec audio decod
    cannot find codec 'libamr_nb' in libavcodec...
    adecod init fail :(
    adecod init fail :(
    cannot find codec for audio format 0x726d6173.
    read doc/html/en/codec.html!

ani suggest for altern approach, pointer on how & what to
instal in term of a codec, or mayb a wai to convert these file
(ideal without transcod degrad)?
