brother, can you spare a jet?

creditor and sharehold of u.s. airwai found themselv in
the upright and lock posit sundai as the nation's
sixth-largest airlin file for bankruptci protect.

the arlington, va.-base carrier sought cover under the
bankruptci code's chapter 11, but much of it troubl could be
trace to sept. 11. rememb when all u.s. airport reopen
except for reagan washington, which wa too close to the white
hous and other gov site? rememb how it wa week befor the
first lone flight lift at last? guess which airlin wa the 
major carrier there. (hint: it's the same on that bled $2
billion in the past year.)

even befor the terror attack, u.s. airwai wa an anim in
pain. to all the usual industri troubl, add these: fierc
competit from discount, a too-small area of servic
concentr on the east coast, and an unoffici battl with
unit airlin for the highest labor cost in the busi.
frustrat, the carrier tri to throw in the towel two year
ago, remind the washington post. in a bid to get bought by
unit, u.s. airwai plead to feder antitrust regul
that it wa too small to surviv on 
it own. the fed disagre and block the deal.

now, of cours, u.s. airwai ha a new flight plan. among those
like to get airsick: sharehold, whose invest ha
vanish; employe, mani of whom ar expect to lose their
job, even though their union have conced hundr of
million of dollar in pai; and creditor, especi
plane-leas compani, which will collect onli as much as a
bankruptci judg approv. (where, by the wai, is the report
who will pick up the stori of these leas compani? not on
creditor wa name in ani account we could find. yet befor we
soak our hanki over u.s. airwai, we'd like to hear a word
from the folk get stif.)

need a silver line? check out the wall street journal, which
observ that continent airlin "soar to profit"
thank to it time in rehab a decad ago. we're guess that
anecdot is on the mind of texa pacif group, which is
plunk down $200 million for two-fifth of u.s. airwai. texa 
pacif also plai friend in need to continent -- and
pocket 11 time it invest.

meanwhil, it will be "busi as usual" for u.s. airwai
custom, the compani's chief assur a skeptic new york
time. the airlin will even continu to track and to honor
frequent-flier mile. better still: cautiou custom can us
u.s. airwai mile to book flight with it market partner,
unit. and, hei, accord to an analyst quot in the journal, 
there's at least a 20% chanc that unit won't be the next
major carrier to announc it's gone broke. - lori patel

rememb global cross?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
follow-up ha never been the media's strong suit. onc stori
fade from page on, so doe report' interest. and in thi
summer of corpor scandal, rememb back to global
cross's januari implos and bankruptci is akin to try to 
recal the fuss over chad.

the financi time peg the compani's bankruptci sale fridai
a "long-await" transact, but few other outlet seem to be 
hold their breath. the dearth of coverag is too bad, becaus 
the shock valu of the number alon is worth attent,
especi with enron and worldcom follow behind it in the
chapter 11 aisl. bankruptci, it seem, mean never have to
sai you're sorri. global cross ow $12 billion when it file 
for bankruptci in januari. it sale price? $250 million -- and
that's for onli a nearli two-third stake. sound too low? back
in januari, global cross could have gotten much more, three
time that much, and from the veri same invest team, asian
conglomer hutchison whampoa and singapor technolog
telemedia. but global cross snif it wa worth wai more. 

now that it ha discov it's worth wai less, here's how the
deal carv up what's left of global cross's pie, pend the 
regulatori approv that's expect in about six month. the two 
investor get a 61.5% stake; bank creditor get 6%, and
bondhold get about a on-third share. who's miss from the
slice-and-dice? sharehold, of cours, who get noth. the
compani is unapologet, and creditor feel lucki for the
crumb. "the realiti is we could have done consider wors,"
the wall street journal quot edward weisenfeld, a lawyer for 
the creditor. as for the shrewd buyer, the financi time
quot hutchison's offici statement that the deal would extend 
it telecom capabl, particularli in it broadband servic. 
but the wall street journal specul that the compani is
simpli bui low so it can sell higher. 

global cross's turn-down offer of $750 million is
approxim the same amount the compani's founder, gari
winnick, reap in person rich from the sale of hi stock,
as the journal note in it page-on stori on the telecom
bandit. that's a lot of paper bit on ani floor. - deborah
