hi all,

i have to make a backup plan for a server that is physic veri far awai
from me right now. if for some reason thi server goe south, i have to have
a plan and it ha to be done quickli. the problem is that the personnel that
is on site doesn't know squat about linux (or comput, for that matter),
so it must be someth dead simpl. i wa think of get a spare hard
drive, connect it to the work server, do a dd of the entir disk to the
new disk, and disconnect the disk (the peopl there can swap hard disk).
someth like

dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1024

assum that sda is the work disk and sdb is the new, unformat and
unpartit disk. so if hte machin break, i can get the new disk and put
in a new machin and everyth should work. thi server is do firewal
and openvpn, etc, no x, no fanci stuff. is thi go to work? what do you
gui think?

cheer!

ivan
