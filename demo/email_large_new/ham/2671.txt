re: 10.6 updat 2 crash idea on past codehi gui,
                the problem is caus by an npe in the swing =
access code when a jlist subclass overrid the =
getaccessiblecontext() method and return null. you can hit thi crash =
when us a tool that scan the intellij ui us the access =
api. we believ we have a fix for it, but as a workaround if you avoid =
us tool that us access with intellij, you can avoid the =
crash.

thank,
