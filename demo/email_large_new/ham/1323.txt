  | hmmm, i assum you're go to report thi to the nmh folk?

it turn out, when i did some investig, that my memori of how mh
work here wa wrong (that's not unusu) - the -seq switch seem to
have alwai done -nolist (requir a subsequ -list to turn it on
again).

given that, i have no idea how the pick code as it wa ever work.  in
fact, it quit possibl never did the wai it wa intend to (i have just
been brows the 2.5 sourc, and that seem to be attempt to do thing
that i never saw happen).

it mai be that your new sequenc method just expos the bug that had been
there all along.

given thi, i won't be send ani bug report to the nmh peopl.  if nmh
ever seem to be show ani sign further progress, and if i rememb thi
then, i might send them a chang request.   the code to make the chang is
trivial.
