of cours, "umount, then remov" is the normal wai to remov usb stick
(and ani other storag). but as far as main idea of automount is
"easi (un)plug" (in my opinion at least), we have littl weird but
work principl "sync, then unplug, and udev will carri out
everyth els". as i alreadi said, it's realli weird, but it work.

but all you said made me hard think about the wai i mount and
unmount my remov media. mayb i should forget about sync and us
'umount /mnt/sd[a-z]' instead, or even write littl script which will
ask me which devic i want to unmount=e2=80=a6 dunno. but thank for sharin=
g
your thought with me!

p.s. camal=c3=b3n, pleas forgiv me for send previou mail directli to
you, not to the list. i think it's time to drop gmail web interfac
and switch back to local email client=e2=80=a6

with best regard,
alexand batischev
