it look not so normal to me.

but look at debian wiki for eee system it seem to be a known issu 
with power manag:

power manag

on some model, the batteri info is not veri precis (jump from 10% to 
100%, no rate inform, etc.). appar, thi is normal. it appear 
that the userspac batteri util expect the batteri to report mah, 
but in fact it report percentag. thi is either a bug in the batteri 
firmwar or a bug in the bio; it is known to be fix with newer bio 
version and kernel ≥ 2.6.25.

tht.
