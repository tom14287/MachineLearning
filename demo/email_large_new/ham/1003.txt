i thought that too but with these two card

 displai control: ati technolog inc rv280 [radeon 9200 pro] (secondari) (rev 01)
 vga compat control: nvidia corpor nv34 [geforc fx 5200] (rev a1)

/var/log/xorg.0.log ha no problem report

  (ii) radeon(0): edid data from the displai on output: dvi-0 ----------------------
  (ii) radeon(0): manufactur: del  model: 400d  serial#: 1094992983
  (ii) radeon(0): year: 2006  week: 2

for the radeon card, and

  (ii) nouveau(0): edid for output vga-1
  (ii) nouveau(0): manufactur: del  model: 400c  serial#: 1094992983
  (ii) nouveau(0): year: 2006  week: 2

for the nvidia card. avail resolut and edid (in hex) ar also
record.

with an onboard nvidia adaptor

 vga compat control: nvidia corpor nvcrush11 [geforc2 mx integr graphic] (rev b1)

there is no edid inform in xorg.0.log. i get 1024x768 on the consol
and in x. the nativ resolut of the panel is 1280x1024. thi is a step
up on the nv driver which will give onli 800x600 without be told
otherwis in xorg.conf.

so i'm disinclin to blame the behavior of the monitor.

not the same card as my onboard nvidia but thi is close to the behaviour
i've experienc:
