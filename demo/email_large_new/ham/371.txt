re: the curs of india's socialismi think that thi and other articl confus social with 
bureaucraci.  libertarian as implement in north america is not 
exactli the shine pinnacl of econom effici.

just try start a telephon compani in the us or (even wors) 
canada.  it can take a year or more to get the bless of our own 
"permit raj" at the fcc, puc, and ptt (or, in the decidedli more 
socialist lean canada, industri canada and the crtc).

yet, despit all of thi intens regul and paper push, as 
well as regulatori scrutini by the ftc, sec, and ir, the 
execut of telecom compani have manag to bilk the invest 
commun for what look to be ten of billion of dollar.  thei 
finish their routin with the a quadrupl lutz -- lai off 
hundr of thousand of worker when it all came crash down.

so.. tell me again.. how ar we better off?
