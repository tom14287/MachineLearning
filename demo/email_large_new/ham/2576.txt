re: thank for the gamix sourc rpm! [alsa stuff]i wish i could answer your question but my laptop doe not have the digit stuff
hook up :( so i so not know about it. i have an excel ess maestro3 which oss
support pretti lame so i wa forc to learn about alsa.

i have us these command to explor alsa and my chip:

arecord -l   (list devic)
arecord -l   (list pcm decic)

i get some output like thi:

> arecord -l
card 0: maestro3 [ess allegro pci], devic 0: allegro [allegro]
  subdevic: 1/1
  subdevic #0: subdevic #0

> arecord -l
pcm list:
 (snip - crapload of output)

i notic that the output from thi command kind of map to what the alsamix or
gamix have.

for what it is worth, here is what i have in modul.conf for my sound stuff:

> ## alsa portion
> alia char-major-116 snd

> alia char-major-14 soundcor
