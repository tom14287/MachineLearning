what do you want to achiev in thi thread on thi debian-kde user support=
=20
mailinglist?

resurrect kde 3.5 for debian?

well did you?

if not, i suggest you to try it elsewher.

possibl place ar:

=2d debian-qt-kde@list.debian.org sinc that is where develop of debia=
n=20
kde packag is coordin

=2d triniti desktop environ / vector linux

thi is for kde user support. kde 3.5 in lenni. kde 4 in squeez unless=20
someon - except the current debian kde / qt develop team - doe and=20
maintain kde 3.5 packag that ar co-instal and meet debian high=20
packag standard.

thi list is not for develop issu like develop / maintain kde=20
3.5 packag for squeez.

so imho ani further request for kde 3.5 in squeez is off topic on thi=20
list as debian kde/qt maintain repeatedli said thei won't.

you want kde 3.5 for squeez? spend your energi toward that goal. here it=
=20
appar doe not chang the situat.

ciao,
