ok, gotcha.

i don't think you can do that with exmh, but you can do it on the
command line, if you us sh or ksh:

	for f in `folder -fast -r`
	do
		echo sort $f ...
		sortm +$f
	done

it could take a long time.

at work, i have to us outlook.  ick.  i hate it.  but it doe a few
thing right.  like make indic for each folder, and not just by
date, but also by sender, messag size, subject.  so i can sort by ani
column instantli.

i believ thi is possibl, too, with an imap compliant reader,
provid the imap server make such indic.

i am face the fact that exmh ha been left behind in some industri
standard.  i us it for my person mail.  my mail server run unix,
and i connect over ssh and tunnel my x traffic over ssh.  with a slow
link, thi make exmh veri slow.  and mime handl is pretti bad
compar with modern mailer.  i am just scare to move.  i've been
us mh or nmh sinc 1985 and exmh sinc 1995.  17 year is a long
time!
