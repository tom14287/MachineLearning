bright osd in squeezehi,

i am run up-to-date squeez on a dell latitud d420. i have a
trivial problem, but such thing bother me :-)

the hotkei for volum and bright adjust work out of the box in a
gnome session. howev, when i adjust the volum us the hotkei, i see
a nice transluc on-screen displai of the volum level. thi is not
the case for bright control.

interestingli, i briefli instal kde a coupl of dai ago. i then
found that, *dure a gnome session*, the bright osd did appear. it
vanish again after i remov kde.

so, the kde instal seem to pull in some packag which is
respons for the bright osd. ani idea which of the dozen of
packag it might be?
