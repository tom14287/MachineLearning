subject: [ilug] newbi seek advic - suse 7.2


folk,

my first time post - have a bit of unix experi, but am new to linux.


just got a new pc at home - dell box with window xp. ad a second hard
disk
for linux. partit the disk and have instal suse 7.2 from cd, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

i have a dell brand e151fpp 15" lcd flat panel monitor and a nvidia
geforc4
ti4200 video card, both of which ar probabl too new to featur in suse's
default
set. i download a driver from the nvidia websit and instal it us
rpm.
then i ran sax2 (as wa recommend in some post i found on the net),
but
it still doesn't featur my video card in the avail list. what next?

anoth problem. i have a dell brand keyboard and if i hit cap-lock
twice,
the whole machin crash (in linux, not window) - even the on/off switch
is
inact, leav me to reach for the power cabl instead.

if anyon can help me in ani wai with these prob., i'd be realli grate -
i've search the 'net but have run out of idea.

or should i be go for a differ version of linux such as redhat?
opinion
welcom.

thank a lot,
peter
