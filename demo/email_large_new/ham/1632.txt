hi,

i have the huawei e1762 usb dongl run under lenni and squeez
us pppd as were i live i have no access to dsl or cabl.

with lenni you need to instal the the kernel 2.6.30 from debian
backport[1] first, as the 2.6.28 kernel onward will flip flop the
devic for you. at the moment it mayb just be pick up as a mass
storag devic and not a modem if you still us the 2.6.26 kernel.
and if you want to stai with the 2.6.26 kernel you will have to
instal usb-modeswitch[3].

set up wvdial thi might help you[2].
