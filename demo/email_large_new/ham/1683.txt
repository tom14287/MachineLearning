i don't think that you need "# updatedefaultentri=true" if you ar
us "default save". iiuc, i onli ha ani mean in the case of
"default x" where x is a number.

iiuc, "# savedefault=true" will append "savedefault" to the menu
entri and, boot from on of those entri turn it into the
default at the next boot if you choos "default save".

i have not tri "default save" with grub1, but with grub2 it will
not work (the first time that you set it) if you don't run
"grub-set-default x" where x is the default entri that you want (the
count start with 0).
