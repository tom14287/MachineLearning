oop! i meant to sai vm/370 releas 6, not vm/sp releas 6.  vm/sp
releas 6 is still proprietari.

these ar some of the issu that someon write portabl code
for ascii vs. ebcdic implement need to worri about.

(1) collat sequenc.  in ascii, the collat sequenc is number
(0-9), follow by uppercas letter (a-z), follow by lowercas
letter (a-z).  special charact ar mix throughout.  in ebcdic,
the collat sequenc is lowercas letter (a-z), follow by
uppercas letter (a-z), follow by number (0-9).  so record
sort alphabet sort in a differ order.

(2) assumpt of continu.  in ascii, the code a-z and a-z
ar contigu, with no code in between.  in ebcdic, there ar
six non-contigu rang, a-i, j-r, s-z, a-i, j-r, s-z.  most
of the code in between ar non-printabl charact, but not
all.  for exampl, ~ sort abov r and below s, } sort abov i
and below j, and \ sort abov r and below s.

(3) hidden assumpt about control code.  a program mai, for
exampl, assum that x'0a' is a line feed and hard code it
somewher.  in ascii, that is true.  but in ebcdic, a line feed
is x'25'.

(4) 7-bit assumpt.  in u.s. standard ascii, all the printabl
charact ar between the hex valu of x'00'-x'7f'.  code
abov x'7f' ar not standard code.  histor, these indic
the combin of the "meta" kei with a regular code.  in
ebcdic, the code ar sprinkl throughout the entir rang of
x'00' through x'ff', with the numer symbol 9 have the highest
code of ani normal printabl charact (x'f9').

thi is not an exhaust list, but it give you an idea
of what to watch for.  although the
follow tabl ha a few mistak, thi link will give you
an idea of ascii vs. ebcdic code.
