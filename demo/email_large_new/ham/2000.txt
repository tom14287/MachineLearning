i solv the overh problem i had by us util
under vista enabl to set the processor for low frequenc
oper (as oppos to dyamic frequenc control), and to
select the power-save mode.

on of the util wa in a toshiba folder under all
program, anoth wa in the vista util folder.  (sorri
to be vagu, i'm not keen to risk undo my present success
to doubl-check. :-)

vista report that the os would need to be reboot
for the set to take effect.

when i reboot into linux, i discov that the
fan would speed up at temperatur of 80c.
also, plai video no longer caus overheat
and shutdown.

idl temperatur ar wai down in a reason rang,
around 60c.

the laptop us insyd h2o bio, which provid
no facil for set power-relat paramet.
fan control and other function ar reportedli 
avail via the omnibook modul. i have yet to test
thi, and no immedi need, have dealt with the
biggest thorn.

regard,
