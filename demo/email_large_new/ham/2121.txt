packag my stuff pleas :pif i have ani rpm in

http://www.dudex.net/rpm/

that could be us to some on with a real apt repositori or someon who want to
maintain a packag, be it known i am not selfish :)

i found stuff i thought would later get popular so i would not have to maintain the
rpm for them after thei hit the big time. gnump3d is an exapmpl of thi.

so if anyon is psych, go for it. if so, let me know so i can get the rpm from
you in the futur.
