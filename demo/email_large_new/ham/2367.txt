re: exmh bug?
the wai to debug someth like thi is to turn on the log (prefer 
-> hack support -> debug log enabl) and track the gpg command 
be issu and the respons.

fwiw, us exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 i do not have problem send 
encrypt messag to myself. when i select the messag, an xterm 
window pop up ask for the passphras. i don't recal exmh ever 
ask me for the passphras from the tty that start exmh nor from a 
dialog box. (but then again, i'm not a heavi gpg user).
