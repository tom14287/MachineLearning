cross-platform developmenthei all,

	i realiz thi ha come up befor, but i am still confus after  
read through the old email. i have an app that us quicktim for  
java. i would like to, mayb not right awai, but at some point, updat  
my app to do the right thing. the right thing, appar, is to us  
qtkit, becaus it is the onli 64-bit solut.

	thi seem crazi to me, though, becaus it is os x specif, which  
mean i need anoth solut for window. what is the 64-bit solut  
(go to be) for window? doe thi mean everi develop who want to  
write cross-platform qt code (not just java) is suppos to write  
their own portabl layer for quicktim? is there an open sourc  
solut out there or in the work? is there anoth solut that  
peopl ar us other than qt?

i need file convers from a wide varieti of file type (esp audio)  
and video playback, although i will need some edit in the futur.  
jmf+javasound won't cut it. not even close. i need wai more file  
format than thei support. you us to be abl to us qtj as a plugin  
for jmf to provid file read/write. perhap there is a wai to do  
that with a minim qt java layer? okai, now i'm just think out  
loud. sorri.

	ani thought, advic pointer ar appreci. i have not seen the  
cross-platform issu address, and the onli replac for qtj i've  
seen ar os specif (eg rococoa).

thank,

	bjorn
