cool, on less packag to maintain :)

on interest thing about alsaplay is that redhat's xmm packag in rh8 will
probabl not plai mp3 file. but alsaplay doe plai mp3s "out of the box".

also, thei ar develop rapidli in their cv and look like their next version
of alsapla will be pretti cool, but i have no idea when it will be readi.
