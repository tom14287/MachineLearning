script gnome-panelsi have a small bashscript which prepar a dual-monitor setup for my 
laptop, sinc i'm move in and out of the offic and meet, i tend 
to attach and disconnect the monitor a few time a dai.

that work fine with xrandr, but the issu is that i would like some 
gnome panel to move, and add on to the extra monitor. i have googl 
around but cant seemt o find that it would be possibl, but it must be 
in some wai, us usual. so, ani hint?

basic, add on panel to on monitor, and add a window list to that 
panel.

best regard,
   eric
