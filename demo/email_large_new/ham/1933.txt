re: the curs of india's social
the question is why ar thei still poor?

especi given the success of indian immigr in other societi?

south korea wa a lot poorer after the korean war than ghana when it
gain it independ at about the same time.  that wa after india
gain independ, and korea couldn't have been in better shape at
that point than india (my impress).
