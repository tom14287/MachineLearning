(not disagre with the gener point.)

for what it's worth, i've been run eclips (on 10.6, 64-bit) with
the usecompressedooop option for month now - if anyon recal, appl
fix the issu with the default garbag collector so that it now
automat choos on that doesn't crash with that option - and it's
veri fast.

of cours, i onli have my work comput to compar it against (which is
a pentium 4 pc, with a hard drive that appear to have some kind of
ident issu, sinc it obvious think it's a c64 cassett) - but
still, i don't notic ani perform problem.

also note, i'm sure the behaviour is differ on differ benchmark.
i did a quick search and found two benchmark:

http://www.matsim.org/book/export/html/330
http://blog.juma.me.uk/tag/compress-oop/

as it happen, both these show a perform win for the option, but
these ar onli two sampl. i'm sure certain usag pattern ar inde
notic slower so i agre, if us cpu-critic code where
perform is a concern, it's probabl best to work out a repeat
test and try both option. just sai, 'assum' is never a good idea,
but don't assum it'll be slower either. :)
