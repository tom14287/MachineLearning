first of all, i am veri new to linux but am well awar of the need to
learn.  after consider googl with my issu, i gave up and thought i'd
try a mail list instead :)

in attempt to instal the cvm packag (apt-get instal cvm), i reciev a
warn indic that the xdm servic cannot be automat
stop/start and that i should do so manual.

i then us rcconf to remov the littl dot-selector-thingi besid xdm,
which, as far as i understand, should stop the servic immedi, but
error ensu in the rest of the instal and when i continu the
instal again (apt-get -f instal) i reciev the same warn that xdm
is run and need to be stop manual.  check in rcconf, the
servic is alreadi unselect.  take a hint from my background with ms
window, i restart the comput and tri the instal again; same
warn and rcconf still show the servic as unselect.

what am i not understand here?  thank in advanc!
