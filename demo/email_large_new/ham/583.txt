naw, i still disagre, again becaus if i'm go to be so loos
with the definit, then i'd have to sai that i myself am a
genet engin organ.  but i'm natur, babi.  my parent
were attract to each other's phenotyp, mix some gene in the
hope that those genotyp would get in there, and grew me around
them.  sure, thei engin the process when thei select each
other.  but thei didn't engin the genet.  if genet engin
wasn't such an import topic todai, it wouldn't be such an import
distinct.

i guess that the reason that i disagre is that some group argu
against ani check on genet engin us that same argument -
"we've been do it sinc prehistori, so we don't need to appli ani
caution todai".
