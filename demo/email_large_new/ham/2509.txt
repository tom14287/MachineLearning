it should be note that the  --ghost option of automount will creat
an appropri "ghost" directori for the devic's mount point. for the
abov auto.master stanza you could us:
  /var/autof/usb /etc/auto.usb --timeout=### --ghost

thi can lead to a clutter /var/autof/usb directori, howev,
unless you do some udev-base script to manag thing on the fly.
