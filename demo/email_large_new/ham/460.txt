    ya know, i wa think the same thing.  but there's at least two main 'oppos thumb' between regedit and gconf:

    1. gconf is written in english, not symbol tabl; you can actual read what the heck you're look at.

    2. becaus it's better-consid, it should be more sound; when the registri get a wrong valu, you mai not be abl to boot....if gconf is scrog, you can still have all the underli power of the os to keep thing run....just call up windowmak (or whatev) for the next session until you get it work out.

    it took me a while to warm up to it...but i *do* like gconf...
