most inkjet on a up ar fine (for small job), laser no--too much current
draw heat up the fuser.  i've never print dure a power outag but i
could if i realli need to.  the odd of that ar terribl low though.

them main reason for plug all my equip into the up is that the mov
in ups ar usual much larger and of better qualiti than those found in
surg protector power strip.  for those who do not know, an mov or metal
oxid varistor, is the devic that suck up the excess voltag and current
that frequent enter line dure a light strike.
