i hear you.  i'll have to look at the code to see if that's easili separ
out.  i start with the purpos of ad an enhanc to support cm
format disk.  i stumbl across the bug in the start block calcul
for ldl format disk in the process.  cm format disk ar handl
*exactli* the same as ldl format disk if the disk is not reserv.  i
would have had to fix that bug anywai to add support for cm disk, sinc
i want the cm support to be correct.  the onli wrinkl wa correctli
handl reserv cm disk.  to do that i had to access the reserv block
offset in the cm label, which prompt thi thread.

all of thi is specif to the s390 architectur and ha no bear on i386,
amd64, ia64, etc.  i hope upstream (gnu, i believ) will accept the fix.
i have no reason to believ that thei won't.
