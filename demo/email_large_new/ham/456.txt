thi is someth that often annoi me. programm can spend hour inlin
code and reli on optimis tool to improv perform. the best
perform improv can be obtain by fix the algorithm.

most function call get made veri rare. optimis them often make no
sens, produc illeg code and nonsens algorithm.

inlin will help in function that get call frequent and ar small -
such as string manipul routin. but these ar a small part of most
applic.

on exampl i frequent see is peopl optimis a databas function call.
most databas access involv mani abstract layer and million of
instruct cycl. try to save a few instruct cycl would be a cost
save of, sai, 5 second in 20 hour.

but a simpl hashmap cach of common data without ani compil or inlin
optimis can turn that same 20 hour into 10 minut.
