when is an 'appropri' time?

and how do appl decid which user group to 'acknowledg in a proud  
fashion'
there ar group out there that onli have a dozen or so member.  
other seem to a larg portion of member still us powerpc base  
machin. and from my experi, it seem veri few 'tradit' user  
group actual cater for the demograph that appl is now chase.

what make your group 'an ideal audienc'?
i'm suggest that you aren't... in fact, i am curiou to see how all  
user group feel about thi point!
ar user group in fact the 'ideal audienc' for appl? or would appl  
just be preach to the convert?

over at my own websit, i recent highlight a seri of post from  
o'reilli on how to deal with speaker cancel
http://www.appleus.org/share/oreilli-share-how-to-deal-with-speaker-cancel/

everi group i have ever known ha had to deal with thi on time or  
anoth... i've been in the situat where i've had to find a last  
minut replac or usual be the last minut replac. ye it  
is embarrass, but these thing do unfortun happen.

i've even been known to be the caus of such cancel to group  
myself :(
often i'm book month's in advanc to present to a group... then  
circumst chang and i have to cancel.
other time, i've had initi discuss about present, again  
month in advanc, and then i hear noth until the night befor the  
present... ask if am i still ok with 'tomorrow' !@#!$!$^ 
%&^*(q@# is all i can sai.

there ar plenti of wai of gentli remind a present that thei  
have a present come up soon... and hark back to the origin  
topic of thi thread... a forward of a press releas you've sent  
out a month befor the meet that mention the 'forthcom meet  
next month' is on simpl wai of do so. it also show that you care  
enough about the topic/present to promot it.

how much commun did you have with the store lead up to the  
'present'?
sure, you weren't discuss thing even the week befor the meet

in mani case, it is the best place for mani peopl.
i hate to sai it, but i cring at some of the comment i see on user  
group mail list etc about what a product mai or mai not do and how  
wrong those respons ar!
an exampl i've seen twice on differ list in recent week is the  
point about ipad and if thei ar 'lock' to at&t...; for starter  
both peopl inquir were talk about ipad with wifi onli - so  
automat there is no need to even mention been lock in to  
at&t.;  secondli, both group were locat in australia and whilst on  
wa talk about import an ipad from the us, the other wa ask  
if thei could us it in the uk when thei visit famili there later in  
the year.
steve job made it abundantli clear in hi keynot speech launch  
the ipad that it wa not lock to ani carrier... yet on both mug  
list, peopl respond sai the ipad wa like to be lock in to  
at&t; and so the peopl inquir would not be abl to us the ipad as  
thei had hope... which wa just plain wrong!

now, i not sai that user group alwai get it wrong... more often  
then not thei don't and thei do actual provid an independ  
viewpoint... for exampl, the discuss on thi veri list about how  
best to demo an ipad wa veri enlighten and provid far more  
inform on the topic then i got out of my contact at appl  
australian (and appl us) on how do do the same thing when the iphon  
first came out here (about 18 month after the us go it - so it wasn't  
exactli the latest new then and i'm sure other had similar queri  
at  the time).

> the messag of user group is lost in the scale of the appl media  
> presenc.

then it is up to user group to address that themselv.... which  
again hark back to the origin topic of thi thread

here in australia, we have taken step toward address thi... i  
produc a full page flyer promot activ appl user group here.

see page 15 of the feb/mar issu of the appleus spotlight (a 30+  
page digit format magazin i publish here in australia) for an  
exampl of the ad.
http://www.appleus.org/magazin/februari-2010-issu-of-appleus-spotlight-now-avail/

the 'electron' copi of the flyer ha each user group name as an  
activ hyperlink, so peopl can jump straight to a group in their state.
if it appear in a print magazin or flyer, then there is still the  
simpl url that can easili be type in which land you at a page with  
link to the variou group own webpag.

the 'primari' url us on the flyer wa actual put to a vote and  
everyon agre that we wouldn't us the www.appl.com/au/usergroup  
link (or even the www.appl.com.au/usergroup on) as quit a few of  
the 'activ' group here have chosen not to be list there - so thei  
can be seen as been independ from appl (and ani other retail)  
and also due to the fact that list often fall out of date.


i just realis that the ad need updat - we don't mention the ipad  
in the current version :)

we also have a portrait version on hand if we need it... in fact, the  
flyer start out as an a4 size portrait flyer when we were approach  
to have an ad in on of australian macworld's super guid public  
- unfortun we couldn't arrang enough fund to go ahead with  
the idea in the time frame at hand... but now we have a solid basi to  
work from the next time an opportun present itself

there is noth stop a group of user group in a 'state',  
'region' or 'area' from get togeth and produc their own  
version of such an ad.

i also love what mac user uk have done with their googl map show  
the locat of each user group in the uk (and ireland)
http://www.macusersuk.org/mug/mugsmap.php  i realli must work out how  
to creat such a map for australian user group :)

actual, most 'concert' and major event organis discourag  
'hawker' from 'hassl' peopl at the gate/entranc... but thei'll  
quit happili take your group monei and let you have a concess  
stand near by (and usual take a percentag of your gross take as  
well)

and why should appl be expect do the market for independ user  
group???
ye, i know user group 'promot' appl product... but we have chosen  
to do so... we aren't compel to do so.
we come togeth in user group (or even in onlin commun such as  
thi) to meet with like mind peopl and discuss thing about a  
common topic of interest to us... just like there ar group that get  
togeth as book club, or reptil keeper, even "gunzel" get  
togeth through their common interest in train (real on and model  
on).  no on make them form these group nor forc peopl to  
particip... and most other 'hobbi' aren't so (un)fortun to  
have a 'central' busi or entiti to focu around, yet thei surviv  
and even flourish all by themselv.
