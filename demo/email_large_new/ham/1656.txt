ext3 basic sync to disk everi 5 second or so.  ext4 didn't, but it's=

possibl that ha been / will be put back.  xf us longer gap between di=

sync by default, but it is tunabl.

you could alwai us the "sync" file system option to avoid the whole issu=
=2e =20
if that's no good enough, a simpl shell script (while sleep 5; do sync; do=

run as root (perhap start from init) will fill basic the same ro=

both xf and ext3/4 recov through journal replai, and it is usual enoug=
h. =20
rare, a manual filesystem check will be requir, and xf_check is usual=
y=20
much faster than fsck.ext3 or even fsck.ext4.
