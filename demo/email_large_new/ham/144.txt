thi is a problem with the linux buffer cach implement, not ani on
filesystem.  the problem isn't the code itself, but the fact it is a trade
off between perform and data integr.  no journal filesystem will
prevent the loss of data in the linux buffer cach when the machin crash.
 what thei will do is zero out or delet ani file that were not fulli
written befor the crash in order to keep the fs in a consist state.  you
will alwai lose data that's in flight, but your fs won't get corrupt due
to the journal replai after reboot.  if you ar serious concern about
loss of write data that is in the buffer cach when the system crash, you
should mount your filesystem with "-o sync" in the fstab option so all
write get flush to disk without be queu in the buffer cach.

i can't speak well to ext4, but xf ha been fulli product qualiti for
mani year, sinc 1993 on irix when it wa introduc, and sinc ~2001 on
linux.  there wa a bug identifi that result in fs inconsist after a
crash which wa fix in 2007.  all bug fix work sinc ha dealt with minor
issu unrel to data integr.  most of the code fix work for quit
some time now ha been cleanup work, optim, and write better
document.  read the post to the xf mail list is veri
inform as to the qualiti and perform of the code.  xf ha some
realli sharp dev.  most ar current or former sgi engin.

xf ha even more tune option than ext4--pretti much everi fs for that
matter.  with xf on a 32 bit kernel the max fs and file size is 16tb.  on a
64 bit kernel it is 9 exabyt each.  xf is a better solut than ext4 at
thi point.  ted t'so admit last week that on function call in ext4 is in
terribl shape and will a lot of work to fix:

"on my todo list is to fix ext4 to not call write_cach_page() at all.
we ar serious abus that function atm, sinc we're not actual
write the page when we call write_cach_page().  i won't go into
what we're do, becaus it's too embarass, but suffic it to sai
that we end up call pagevec_lookup() or pagevec_lookup_tag()
*four*, count them *four* time while try to do writeback.

i have a simpl patch that give ext4 our own copi of
write_cach_page(), and then simplifi it a lot, and fix a bunch
of problem, but then i discard it in favor of fundament redo
how we do writeback at all, but it's go to take a while to get
thing complet right.  but i am work to try to fix thi."

good hardwar raid card ar realli nice and give you some featur you
can't realli get with md raid such as true "just yank the drive trai out"
hot swap capabl.  i've not tri it, but i've read that md raid doesn't
like it when you just yank an activ drive.  fault led drive, audibl
warn, ar also nice with hw raid solut.  the other main advantag is
perform.  decent hw raid is almost alwai faster than md raid, sometim
by a factor of 5 or more depend on the disk count and raid level.
typic good hw raid realli trounc md raid perform at level such as
5, 6, 50, 60, basic anyth requir pariti calcul.

sound like you're more of a casual user who need lot of protect disk
space but not necessarili absolut blaze speed.  linux raid should be fine.

take a closer look at xf befor make your decis on a fs for thi
arrai.  it's got a whole lot to like, and it ha featur to exactli tune
xf to your mdadm raid setup.  in fact it's usual automat done for
you as mkf.xf queri the block devic devic driver for stride and width
info, then match it.  (~$ man 8 mkf.xf)

xf user:

 the linux kernel archiv

"a bit more than a year ago (as of octob 2008) kernel.org, in an ever
increas need to squeez more perform out of it's machin, made the
leap of migrat the primari mirror machin (mirror.kernel.org) to xf.
we site a number of reason includ fscking 5.5t of disk is long and
pain, we were hit variou cach issu, and we were seek better
perform out of our file system."

"after initi test look posit we made the jump, and have been quit
happi with the result. with an instant increas in perform and
throughput, as well as the worst xf_check we've ever seen take 10
minut, we were quit happi. subsequ we've move all primari mirror
file-system to xf, includ www.kernel.org , and mirror.kernel.org. with
an averag constant movement of about 400mbp around the world, and with
peak into the 3.1gbp rang serv thousand of user simultan it's
been a file system that ha taken the brunt we can throw at it and held up
spectacularli."
