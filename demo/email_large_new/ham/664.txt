i rememb i ask on kde-develop and thei said thei don't have the
ressourc to support it. but what i mean is that someon should care to
get the code compil on newer librari. thi could be challeng though
if the code is work atm, it's not that much effort to keep it run at
least for the next few year.

the interest is present i think, but not in the focu of interest of kde
manag/develop team. i person could and will make a repo for my
need ... but it doe not seem to be urgent atm. if someon start similar
project i would love to know and join.

hm, so we have to think about do someth like kde3.10 for debian
squeez. i person hate k/ubuntu but there ar few veri us featur
in the 3.10 version there.

thi plan could cover 3-4 year. and in that time kde4 should have matur
enough to fit our need.

as far as i know kde3 is not in squeez (app ar support but framework
not) or am i wrong?

what do you think?
