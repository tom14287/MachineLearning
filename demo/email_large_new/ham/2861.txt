 just to solv thi...the reason i wa boot the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 wa becaus /dev/md0 wasn't boot - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.

 it turn out that thi is becaus i wa popul md0 with tar. which
seem to have 'issu' with crosslink file - for instanc, it wa
try to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and fail. it wa onli
as i did it again with a friend present, that he spot the error, and
queri them. we notic that the hard link file just didn't exist on
the new rootf.

 when we duplic the filesystem with dump instead of tar, it work
fine, i wa abl to tell lilo to us root=/dev/md0 and everyth work.

 woohoo.
