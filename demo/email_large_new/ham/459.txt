if wallet were all unlimit, we'd all have all our dimm slot max.  i
made the same argument as you quit some time ago in favor of 32bit linux
for small system such as netbook.  i wa shot down and educ on the
actual memori footprint of the x86-64 binari, and it turn out thei're not
that much larger overal, and not nearli to the size that on should need
4gb ram on a netbook.  most of them come with 2gb anywai, which should be
more than enough for just about all applic mix, whether on choos a
64bit os+app or 32bit.

correct in that on should get 4gb on a netbook due to 64bit binari size?
or correct that 64bit binari ar (slightli) larger than 32bit binari?
i'd agre with you on the latter but not on the former.  state the case of
the former is spread misinform.  i attempt to shoot it down.  it
is simpli not correct to recommend 4gb for the reason you state.

apolog.  it wasn't meant as an insult but as an exclam point back
incredul.
