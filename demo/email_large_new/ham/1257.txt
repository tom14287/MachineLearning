re: [razor-user] problem with razor 2.14 and spamassassin 2.41thi is due to insuffici write privileg to the "razor-agent.log" 
file. a quick work-around is to do a "chmod go+rx" on that file (of 
cours, it's better to restrict the access as much as possibl).

in agent.pm, when the razor2::logger object is creat, if it doesn't 
have write permiss to the log file it doe not succe. then, later 
in the code when the log object is us, it fail with the "unbless" 
error.

hope thi help,
michael duff
