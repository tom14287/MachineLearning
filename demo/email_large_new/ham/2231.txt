as i understand it, both network manag and wicd ar intend to
control the network interfac.  if you want to control the interfac

interfac should be defin in /etc/network/interfac.  

nm work veri well for me on my ubuntu lucid laptop.  meanwhil, my
debian desktop util /etc/network/interfac as it doesn't roam
anywher.
