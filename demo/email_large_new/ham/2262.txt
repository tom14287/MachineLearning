you can just recompil the apt sourc rpm, if it's the newer on. (such
as mine). there's no depend on libstdc++ other than binari on.

current on releas dwd2, which i'm us on my home rawhid box.
(obvious not product, sinc the old apt work fine on product
box).

now... doe anyon know of a good wai to delet "old" rpm from a
directori contain both "new" and "old" rpm? sai i have
blurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and
blurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remov the blurb-0.1.0-* becaus of
the presenc of blurb-0.1.1-1? anyon have a conveni script?

dave.
