i am not quit sure what's an "appropri neg liter" and whether =
it's present or absent, but perhap it's just that there's a fine point =
there which escap me (i do admit i did not check the doc, it might us =
the term befor in a wai which make the statement unambigu).

what's -- imho of cours -- pretti mislead is what follow though. =
seem to me we ar check the word object variabl veri veri =
explicitli -- you can't be much more explicit in test xxx than =
write "while (xxx)".

what we ar -- in fact -- test _implicitli_ is whether the _enm_ =
object variabl might contain nil.

or do implicit/explicit mean someth els in english than in all other =
languag i bump into?

best,
