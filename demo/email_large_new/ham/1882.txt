two more hint:

1/ the error messag you got wa:

***
(...)
cannot find codec for audio format 0x726d6173.
read doc/html/en/codec.html!
***

so follow their wise advic and take a look into that doc file. 

2/ dunno if you alreadi instal the mpeg/ffmpeg version from "debian-
multimedia" repo, as ron alreadi point out. that could be anoth thing 
you can test.
