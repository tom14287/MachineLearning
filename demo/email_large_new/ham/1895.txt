i think i could handl comment out the lowest spam_phrase_xx_yy
score.  if the ga could handl thi sort of thing so thei'd
automat be zero, i'd feel better sinc the rang could chang
next time the phrase list is regener or the algorithm tweak.

i think we need to understand why date_in_past_48_96 is so low befor
we remov it.  the two rule on either side perform quit well.

probabl a few, those seem like the best prospect to me.

i onli want a bugzilla ticket for each on if peopl ar okai with
quick wontfix close on the on deem unworthi of recoveri.

if you could put the stat for each rule in the ticket somehow (should
be automat with email at the veri least), it would help.
