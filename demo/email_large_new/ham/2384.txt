re: fromthi is not an exmh problem, but an interact between sendmail, solari and 
mh.

your sysadmin is wrong.  it is the respons of the receiv mail 
server to escap line begin with "from " if thei choos to turn on that 
facil.  it is not the respons for email client to cater to the 
stupid design of the unix mail spool, and sun's even more stupid decis to 
reli on "content-length:" instead of deal with thi problem.  sinc mh is 
unawar of "content-length:", rcvstore gag try to pars messag from the 
spool.

i had thi same problem.  there ar sever wai to fix it:

1)  get your mail administr to add the "e" flag to your sendmail.  thi 
mean you will never see a line begin with "from ".  ani such line will 
look like ">from ".

2)  there is a patch to mh to make it respect "content-length:".  when i wa 
have thi problem, port thi patch to nmh wa low on the prioriti list, 
then nmh develop stall for a long time.  i doubt it ha been done, but 
you can check with the nmh list at nmh-worker@mhost.com to find out for sure.

3)  you can learn to us procmail, invok rcvstore directli instead of 
let sendmail put your incom mail into the spool.  thi avoid the 
whole issu.  rcvstore onli deal with a singl messag at a time, and 
everyth work.
