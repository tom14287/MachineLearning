there ar a few differ wai to deal with not expos your password
to the world, but on thing i do want to note: in a host situat,
you should have a user home directori in addit to the directori for
your websit.  if you need a file to be inaccess from the web, you
can just put it in your home directori.  there's no need for root
level permiss.
