well, the sad stori is that i don't realli want to do s.m.a.r.t. i wa
experienc disk error on the drive which caus someth in the
kernel to throw a fit. when thi happen, the onli recoveri i could
find wa to reboot. thi is slow and not realli a wai to learn how to
fix the problem. so i ask for advic on thi list. i work down the
list of suggest, not have much success, and arriv at
smartctl. but now we know that that doesn't work for reason that i
might have known if i had read the whole of wikipedia and had total
recal --- but i hadn't and i don't.

sinc my last post, i have succeed in do a success, error
free, backup to each of the disk. on notabl fact about all the
error is that after reboot it would appear that no data wa lost and
the backup could be resum from where it advanc to just befor the
crash. the onli thing that i can think that i did differ in these
new success run is that i did not sit at the comput and
watch. can softwar detect be watch? i think not, but ...

my read about esata give me suspicion that it ha it own poorli
document problem. i'm not convinc that i cannot make usb work
without s.m.a.r.t, but i realli don't have ani good idea as to
how. and now, without error happen fairli frequent, i doubt that
i will be abl to test and debug ani approach that i dream up.

thi is for a lan of desktop system, three comput in all. on
comput act as a collector of backup from the itself and the other
two, and is respons for get the file onto an extern drive
in a time wai.

all of the comput ar hand-me-down. none have esata capabl. so
far i have not convinc myself that spend monei would help solv
the problem. perhap in a few year, comput with esata will start
show up in dumpster. mayb i should just wait.
