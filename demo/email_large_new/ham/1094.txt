absolut correct.  i wasn't try to impli the same exact code ha been
around for 17 year.  hell if that wa the case i wouldn't be us it.
whilst the initi linux port effort wa more than a simpl recompil, i
don't believ it wa a herculanean effort.  far more chang to the xf code
have been made sinc inclus in mainlin than the chang requir to get
from irix to linux.

i actual saw a brief video interview of on of the sgi irix dev quit
some time ago in which he describ the initi linux port effort to get it
run on sgi's big origin 3000 mip machin.  thei had to do thi to
start valid how everyth would run under linux becaus thei didn't
have the first itanium altix system manufactur yet.

iirc their testb wa a 32 processor origin 3000 run mip r14k
processor.  thi wa back befor the linux mip port project exist so
thei were in essenc creat the first linux mip port as part of their
effort.  he clearli state that develop/maintain a linux mip port wa
not in the card for sgi, that thi effort wa strictli a valid effort.
 he said it took about a week to get linux boot on the origin system, and
anoth week to get it stabl.  the first xf port to linux wa part of thi
effort.  if it took onli 2 week for the bulk of thi effort, i can't
imagin thei had to modifi a ton of xf code.  irix wa written in c as is
linux, so the chang in xf were probabl fairli minor.

i'd ventur to guess that the most signific linux xf chang were those
for the 32bit x86 code base.  irix and thu xf were born on 64bit mip risc
cpu.  move that to a linux 64bit itanium environ wa probabl
rel straight forward.  move down to a 32bit platform probabl
requir a lot of code chang, as did the initi linux 64bit port up to
alpha, hppa, itanium, and eventu mip64.
