   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

read it like thi: new arrai with 1024 element of type pointer to char.
as a pointer occupi the natur word size (32 bit or 64bit), no wonder
you get 4*1024 (sizeof(char *) * numer_of_element).

sizeof return the size of type. you can us it with var (and then the
normal form is sizeof var, not sizeof(var)), but if you're chang the
type with the var with a cast, of cours you'll get the size of that new
type.
