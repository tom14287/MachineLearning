to my knowledg, no part of the bluetooth framework document
sai anyth about thread safeti, and for that reason you must assum
that it is onli safe to us from the main thread.

also, a thread's run loop will onli run if it ha either run loop
sourc or timer attach; the fact that nsrunloop's -run ever
return mean that it ha neither. thi is what i would expect base
on your -startbluetooththread: method, as it doesn't appear to creat
a sourc or timer. if you want to keep the thread aliv, i would
attach a dummi timer to the run loop that fire after some
extraordinari amount of time. (assum you're not us the bluetooth
api on the thread...)
