i'm now twice a publish author. earlier in the week, i releas my  
top 50 mac os x tip, 
which mark the onli thing i've ever written that i 
expect anyon to pai for. if you happen to us os x, go check them out. 
my second public is a pdf onli explan of the process for 
convert vinyl lp to cd, by wai of your pc (how's that for alphabet 
soup). for the time be, you can get it absolut free, with the 
caveat that i'd appreci some feed back on what could be ad to make 
it more us (i'm consid some screen shot for it if i get some 
time). what ar you wait for -- 
get someth free alreadi.

with the expir of lockergnom's old cell phone plan, lori and i 
opt to make a switch to verizon, at the recommend of brian 
steven. i'm alreadi happi with the suggest, as our previou provid 
had horrid custom servic, not to mention i now have a much geekier 
phone in the form of the 
kyocera qcp 6035 
palm power unit. it's just 
larger than most palm devic on the market, but have the devic 
integr is nice. it ha all the function of a palm, with some 
internet brows capabl and of cours, phone access. a built in 
speakerphon actual work better than i expect,  now all i need to 
do is get more applic instal.

of interest to anyon who sign up for 
emus after chri and i talk 
the servic up and down last week: it seem thei've ad in the ballpark 
of 1,000 univers titl to their roster of offer. not surpris 
consid thei're part of the same conglomer, but still good new 
in term of featur expans.

gif movi gear v3.02 [1129k] w9x/nt/w2k/xp $40
http://www.moviegear.com/gmgdet.htm


the major of gif anim on the web doe absolut noth for 
me. i'm of the mindset that anim is meant to either tell a stori 
or illustr a concept -- not put someth in motion just becaus 
you can. that said, for anyon want to creat anim, thi tool 
make it nice and easi. a storyboard interfac keep you think like 
a movi maker as you build your anim creation, which lend itself 
to help anyon who'd like to get from point a to point b in an 
orderli fashion. the softwar support psd, jpg, avi, bmp, and gif 
format, leav your option open for creat anim segment.

http://www.madshrimp.com/index-e.php?action=webnew-e&l1;=0&l2;=30
 
a littl on the childish side, but thi cd-rom drive test is still veri funni. 
watch as thi group rewrit the rule on drive benchmark. if geek tv were 
more like thi, even non-geek would tune in to watch (which probabl sai 
more than it should about the lowest common denomin). a wmv capabl player 
is requir,.

tapehead (r) 1988
comedi - 93min
review's tilt (2)


 
two out of work rent-a-cop make an attempt to break into the music 
video industri in thi quirki comedi. john cusack and tim robbin 
make thi comedi work, star as the two secur guard as thei 
send up all sort of hollywood stereotyp. you can't help but laugh 
at the ridicul predica these two surviv, as thei ar 
greet with cameo by a who's who of music and movi industri name. 
i'm sure neither robbin nor cusack would openli list thi movi on a 
resum, but it is inde a brilliant perform by both of them, 
especi as a demonstr of their abil to plai off of each 
other. although thi is a late 80's releas (on of the few 80's 
underground classic i hadn't previous seen), it remain relev 
to those out there who ar look to put it to the man. if you've 
ever hate the record industri and it in-crowd attitud, you'll 
love thi film. a close refer to rene's courtyard cafe in santa 
monica, which is a regular stop for me everi time i'm in the la area, 
prompt me to want to watch the film for a second view. the movi 
is humor enough for sever view. noth realli grab attent 
on the dvd, but then again, the studio probabl expect no on will bui 
it anywai.
