thank for the confirm, diederik.  i wonder which packag to file a
bug report against?  the k3b packag mai in fact be easiest to request
that the sound file be packag in .ogg format, but that onli mask
that fact that someth in the kde sound stack is have an issu with
.wav file.

my system is configur to us the phonon xine backend in sound and video 
configur.  could that be the culprit and how can we test?
