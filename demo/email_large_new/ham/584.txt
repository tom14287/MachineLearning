i just check in a code cleanup which doesn't address thi issu, but doe 
take a machet to code right around it.  you ought to 'cv updat' and see if 
your issu becom ani clearer with all the brush remov.

my patch note that 'msgid' and 'line' ar redund with on anoth and remov 
on or the other from function which take both.  the caller ar then 
chang to pass what the function expect.  in the case of msg_chang, the 
'line' argument is remov and we onli have the msgid argument.  ftoc_clearcurr
is now the first line of msgchang.
