 i don't realli see the problem... either the whole messag is unwant spam
which you, on wai or anoth, didn't agre to reciv, or it's someth that
you, on wai or anoth, said that you'd accept... if you said you'd accept it,
like mailinglist, then it isn't spam and shouldn't be caught as spam, no
matter if there's ad in it or not...
