        i've us it, of cours.  kpackag is much easier.  it's rare i sai
that about a gui util vs. a cli on, but in thi case it's true.

        that's just nonsens.  mani packag simpli do not have debian sourc,
and i have us kpackag to successfulli instal mani alien packag. 
in some case, there mai be a reason .deb subsitut, but mani
packag, most notabl hardwar drive, simpli have no substitut.  two
of my raid control, for exampl, onli have rpm distro.  sure you
ar not suggest a pc - debian or otherwis - can do without it hard
drive?  thei instal fine under kde3.
