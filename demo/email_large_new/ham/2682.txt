set up java1.6 on os 10.5hi all,

i'm try to get java1.6 work on my macbook pro 1,1 which ha  
10.5.8 on it. i've download a packag from the openjdk project, and  
i've got it setup us the direct
that i've found at the bottom of thi thread:

http://www.mailarki.com/thread.php?page=1&id;=197627

where i've setup an openjdk6.jar folder in my ~/librari/java/ 
javavirtualmachin directori. i've got the proper directori  
structur, but no luck in have it recogn by the
/usr/libexec/java_home function. nor is it recogn if i try to  
symlink it as a the 1.6.0 folder in the /system/librari/.../version  
path. i think then the culprit mai be my info.plist
file.

doe anyon have ani experi with do thi setup? i've includ  
what my info.plist look like below to see if it's not format  
properli.

thank in advanc.
