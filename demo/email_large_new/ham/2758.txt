i'm sure chuck doesn't deliber leav ani appl user group off hi  
list of forthcom meet :)

but your queri got me think about a few thing...

how mani appl user group actual maintain a pr mail list?

if you do, who do you includ on it?
is chuck from the mug center on it?
sandi, the editor of the appl user group bulletin?
the appl user group resourc websit team?
your appl region liaison?
lynn and fred's infomang?
ar other appl user group in your 'area' includ?
what about pc-base or adob base user group?
your local newspap, commun radio and tv station?
local mayor and other local councillor?
your local appl retail store?
your local appl resel?
your sponsor and advertis?
what about your own committe/board of director? and even your own  
member?
anyon els?


what inform do you send out to the pr list?
just an announc about your next meet?
what about a teaser for the next three meet?
how often do you send them out? weekli, monthli, or just when you have  
a 'major' event?
how far in advanc of your meet do you send them? the dai befor? a  
week befor? two week befor?

do you send html base email? or just plain text?
do you keep an archiv onlin of your past press releas on your  
websit?


if you don't have a pr mail list, why don't you?
