thi is exactli the reason i chose debian 10 year ago when i wa look
for my first linux distro.  i told a friend i want a server distro that
wasn't go to spoon feed me, but make me learn someth about linux.

casei, a season debian sysadmin, recommend i download the debian net
instal floppi and do my first instal from the mirror, onli a compact
base instal, and to instal everyth els i need by hand with apt.
that wa potato with a 2.2 kernel.

i onli us linux for non-gui server.  i don't us desktop linux.  all my
admin'ing requir knuckl bust. ;)  and i like it that wai.
