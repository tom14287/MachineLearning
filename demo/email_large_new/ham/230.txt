if thi is new behaviour in a previous work network, what did you do to it?

  test the cabl by switch which machin ha which.
  test the hub port by switch cabl around.
  run ifconfig on the server - ani error and what kind thei ar.
  test the network card... by replac the thing!

serious, if the server ha a pci slot free, someth like a realtek 8139
base card cost less than 20 euro.  the design is a coupl of gener later
- more memori, less cruft, no *fscking* do config util, no jumper on the
card and it's pci.  

ronan.
