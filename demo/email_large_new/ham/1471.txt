i'm also not familiar with the implement, but i would prefer that
automat instal packag stai automat instal, so that
thei have the possibl of be automat remov when no longer
need.

i us "hold" liber to weather sid storm.  there ar two case i
see crop up: on, aptitud suggest remov packag without an
obviou replac.  two, aptitud mark thing as broken that have
been work just fine.  in either case, i start slam the "=" kei
until packag will no longer be remov, and noth is mark
broken.  thi work 99.99% of the time.  at some later period when i
suspect the storm ha pass, i test the water by unhold the
packag and gaug aptitud's reaction.

i also us "hold" when apt-listbug + some investig lead me to
believ i'm better off with the current version.  (there's some reason
i don't us forbid-version, but i don't recal.  mayb it wasn't
persist between session?  but that would have been year ago.)

all of which is to sai, just becaus i've mark a packag on hold
doesn't mean that i want it on my system forev.  but if that's the
onli wai to deal with the problem, then i can certainli manag.  my
system is ancient, and there ar alreadi plenti of packag on it whose
presenc i can't easili explain.  what's the harm in a few more?

if thi is a misus of "hold" and there's a better wai, though, i'm
all ear.  reread, it seem like "forbid-version" would be the
right call for most of what i'm do, assum it doe persist
between aptitud session.
