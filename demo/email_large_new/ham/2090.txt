argh!! i did upgrad to acroreat 9.3.1 from multimedia unstabl upon
these respons and the referenc articl which wa base upon 9.x.  i
even set a lid_librari_path variabl in case it wa not a typo.  it
still doesn't work.  set the command line debug variabl, i
found that it cannot find the ppd file.  doe it onli work if the cup
server is run local? in our case, we us a central cup server
run on a non-standard port.  thi is reflect
in /etc/cup/client.conf.  how do we tell acroread where the printer
server and ppd file ar? thank - john
