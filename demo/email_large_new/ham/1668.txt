veri interest --- but

my quick googl reveal mani usb drive enclosur for both ata and sata
but the market don't make mention of s.m.a.r.t . what is the brand of
your enclosur. i want to look for it, in particular, and see if it claim
the featur that you have discov. actual, on look a littl more
close, i'm not see ani case of a singl enclosur that can be us
with both ata and sata. do i read your post correctli - your enclosur can
contain either a sata or an ata, and work over usb? but smart onli work
when it is enclos an ata?
