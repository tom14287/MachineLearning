(for me, person, it's theoret, as i onli am repeat thing i 
have pick up.  it mai be out of date, now, but if i had to guess, the 
level of threat ha onli grown.)

it depend on the mechan us to share the folder.  if if is through 
a network interfac, then the risk ar similar to the risk on ani 
trust intranet.

if the folder ar provid by the vm intern, then the risk is what 
you can lose by a success attack on the guest kernel or the host vm. 
  if the host vm is kernel-base, then the risk is that of a (host) 
kernel attack.

note: i'm us "risk" as in "what can you lose?"  if you mean attack 
vector, then those should be evid; again, i am not a secur 
reseach.  googl joanna rutkowska.  she probabl know as much as 
anyon about break out of a vm to attack the host.

i'm sure other on thi list know more than i do about it.
