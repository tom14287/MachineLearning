zero bright post snow leopard upgradeon my white macbook (2007 eta) that i recent upgrad from leopard  
to snow leopard. i have instal all current updat.

now, and not befor, i notic that frequent when i start to re-us  
the machin that it ha zero bright when it power up. the  
'increas bright' control ha no effect (but other kei do work).  
if i close the lid but then reopen it befor the machin goe to sleep  
that usual doe the trick and i have medium(ish) bright and can  
turn bright up or down.

i am test if thi is relat to x11/xquartz so thought i would ask  
here if anybodi els ha experi thi problem.

i can provid more h/w detail later.

thank, m
