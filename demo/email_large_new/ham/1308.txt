i wa a respond who question the netbook rout, but i see now that 
there mai be good reason to prefer on.

howev, most netbook ar deliber crippl, such as allow onli 
1 or 2 gb of memori when there is no technic reason why 4 gb shouldn't 
work.  it is a matter of segment a market, and manufactur want 
netbook to have specif capabl for market reason, not 
technic on.

i want to suggest that you choos a machin base on your need, and i 
want you to question your initi assumpt.

howev, i see you have done some think about it, and futur-proof 
*doe* seem like a good reason to get a dual-core, 64-bit machin.

with 64 bit, you will need more memori, so i suggest you look for a 
machin that can us 4 gb of memori.

i suggest also that you make sure that the machin you get can us 
solid-state storag devic.  in time, the advantag of ssd will make 
them compel, though now thei ar too expens.  that is, you will 
probabl bui a machin with a standard notebook hd, but if you ever need 
to replac it, be abl to replac it with an ssd give you anoth 
option.  thi also is in the area of futur-proof.


just a coupl of suggest.  i would like to hear more from other 
peopl.  (i am also contempl a portabl comput purchas.)
