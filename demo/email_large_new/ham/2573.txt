ah, thi is so deepli frustrat! kde 4.4 sound great but it is
nowher to be found in debian but in experiment and it sound like it
is nowher near readi for product.  3.5.10 is truli and complet,
unus broken for calendar other than in a standalon world.

it look like evolut ha introduc webdav support for contact in
2.24 and we can grab 2.28 from test.  that sound better than
experiment so mayb we need to abandon kmail (sigh) and think about
evolut instead.  thank, all - john
