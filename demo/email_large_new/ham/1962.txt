fact: the c standard doe not sai anyth about machin-level call

fact: the c standard doe not address the behavior which result when
the call site of a function see a prototyp whose return type differ
from the return type present at the definit of the function.

conclus: a conform c compil could us complet differ
techniqu for return 'int' and 'long'.

conclus: in such an abi, machin-level code which arrang for
caller to see an 'int' return valu of 0 could easili be written such
that a caller which expect 'long' to see someth other than zero.

conclus: if you're paranoid about portabl, you can't assum
that messag to nil with a 'long' return type will return 0, with a
strict read of appl's guarante.

and note that absolut noth in the abov is even slightli relat
to integ type size, type convers, cast, promot, the
bit-level represent of the null pointer, or ani other such
thing, so ani discuss of them in thi context is utterli
pointless.
