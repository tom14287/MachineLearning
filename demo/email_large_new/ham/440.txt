after send the report i start fiddl with the ftoc_rescanlin 
stuff and i havn't seen it sinc. i can't realli tell if it wa my 
hack that remov it, or if it wa some transit magic 
happen sinc thi wa the first invoc of that version of 
exmh. i've back out my stuff now, and'll let you know if it happen 
again.


on anoth thing with the ftoc_rescanlin stuff. thi routin is 
call at time still unclar to me. an inspect of the routin 
suggest that it is us in the transit of a messag to/form 
"current" state to re-paint the ftoc line. howev, check the 
msg.tcl code (msgchang) we find:

    if {$msgid != {}} {
        # allow null msgid from msg_showwhat, which suppli line 
instead
        if {$msgid < 0}  return
    } els {
        # line null too, try us first in folder
        if {[string length $line] == 0} { set line 1 }
        set msgid [ftoc_msgnumber [ftoc_findmsg $msgid $line]]
    }
    ftoc_clearcurr
    mh_setcur $exmh(folder) $msgid
    ftoc_showsequ $exmh(folder)

the ftoc_clearcurr call ftoc_rescanlin to clear the '+' sign 
_befor_ the on-disk transit is made. i hack thi stuff and more 
or less chang the order. it work, but fail on some folder chang.

my feel of thi is that we realli do not want to have a 
ftoc_clearcurr, but rather just a rescanlin and the caller had 
better know the line or msgid. that routin shoud just put in the '+' 
if the line/msg in question happen to be the cur msg. thought?
