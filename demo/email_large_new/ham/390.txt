[ilug] nmblookup questionhello all,
i'm try to get win name resolut across subnet work and reckon the
first step is to be 
abl to do a nmblookup without us the -b (broadcast address flag). doe
anyon know how 
samba can be configur to do broadcast to subnet other than just the
local subnet. 
i don't think thi ha anyth to do with the remot announc paramet.

thank
bryan
