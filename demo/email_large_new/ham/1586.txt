you should run "aptitud unmarkauto grub-legaci" and remov the
transit grub packag.  unfortun the case where a transit
packag a pull in anoth packag b is not handl well by the packag
manag, i alwai end up "aptitud unmarkauto b; aptitud markauto a"
to tell apt that i want to keep the new packag and that it can remov
the transit on as soon as noth depend on it anymor.

becaus it decid that the grub-legaci packag is unus and can be
remov despit the pin.  whether thi is the right thing is debat;
i'm sure you find some bug report about that if you dig into the long
list of aptitud bug.
