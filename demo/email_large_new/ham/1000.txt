if there is a maximum trust valu (if trust is some sort of percentag
for instanc), and if it isn't imposs to reach it, that would 
prevent too few peopl to get too much of an avantag. my guess is if 1% 
of razor user can reach thi limit (or be near enough), spammer won't 
be abl to cheat just by build up their trust, thei would need a fair 
amount of fake user too.

now, for the "fair amount of fake user", spammer don't have access to 
mani set of network class. so thei would need a bunch of user come 
from the same set of ip. if the razor server see 100 peopl on a class 
c network (253 ip) report 10000 email a dai, someth wrong is 
go on. thi could also trigger alarm.

as for legitim proxi and the like, 1) a proxi should not report ani
thing (spam should be report by hand, not automat), 2) there mai 
be a wai to have except (ibm network would have lot of user from 
the same set of ip but no like spammer, so no alarm would trigger 
for their network, or better the alarm would be less sensit). aol 
could still give troubl though but even then, for on particular phone 
line/cabl, the set of ip is probabl quit small even less than a class 
c (us network subclass). the spammer could still try to have 
sever connect at differ locat, but that increas their 
cost and so is not so much interest.
