lindow.com report card 

as summer arriv, mani school children ar come home with their
report card.  i thought thi would be a good time to see what kind of
grade lindow.com receiv for their first 9 month in oper..

 
to view the timelin of lindow.com's first 9 month in busi, click
here  . 

oper system:  

as of last week, consum can experi lindowso in on of two wai.
on wai is to bui a comput run lindowso from walmart.com
 , for as littl as $299. thi is a
signific mileston for us, as we've partner with our first builder
(microtel) and retail (walmart). these comput work great out of the
box and ar ideal for gener purpos comput task. 

for those who alreadi have a comput and also wish to try lindowso, we
offer the insid program  . thi give
peopl want earli access to lindowso a chanc to try out lindowso
as it develop. current, insid report instal success about
80%  of the time on their pc. therefor we have some room to grow,
consequ, thi product is not yet for everyon. 

some mai wonder how we can sell a comput at walmart
 when the program avail directli
from lindow.com is bill as not complet readi. the differ is
the walmart   comput ar certifi,
ensur that all compon  work elegantli with lindowso. that's much
differ than offer a softwar program that will work on ani
comput in the world - that's veri difficult. it's the differ
between make a singl pair of shoe for a known foot size versu
open a shoe store with everi style of shoe for everi size foot. the
first on is easi, the second on is a much bigger job.

while the instal is fantast easi and fast (the entir os
instal in under 5 minut), we've got a lot more work to do to support
a wider rang of hardwar, printer and other devic. grade:  b

softwar: 

our goal to give peopl choic mean give them choic not just on
their oper system, but access to all the program thei'll want to
add to their comput to realli make it work for them in their school,
home or busi.

click-n-run   is the easiest wai to
load softwar onto a comput. for the first time a linux base system
ha leapt ahead of microsoft's oper system in eas of us. with
1,000 plu program alreadi in the click-n-run warehous
 , user can find qualiti softwar
titl for just about ani comput task and, with a singl mous-click
download, instal and run these program. all these titl ar includ
in the $99. thi is a fantast consum experi and price point.
look for a lot more great softwar in the warehous in the futur.

microsoft window compat:

we live in a microsoft world, so there need to be a bridg from the
legaci world to the broadband lindowso world. thi mean we need to
support some bridg program, file type and network devic to help
peopl interact with the legaci microsoft world. lindowso comput
come with softwar to view, print and copi popular microsoft
applic like: ms word file, ms powerpoint file and ms excel
document. there's great linux base altern and we'll guid peopl
to those altern (thei're better than most peopl realiz). to edit
microsoft file, we'd highli recommend on of the offic suit in our
warehous such as openoffic
 . 

mani of these program ar of veri high-qualiti and a great valu sinc
thei're includ in the warehous  .
sometim there ar no viabl altern for those program, so we're
invest necessari resourc to support some microsoft window base
program. stai tune for more develop in thi area. our printer
support is ok, but there's lot of room for more driver. connect to
ms window base file server is still a challeng. we need to get
better in the abov area.  grade: b

commun:

we've tri to be dilig in commun where our compani is go
which is why there's typic a weekli michael's minut
 . while our overal goal ha not deviat -
bring choic to your comput - our implement ha becom more
focus as we listen to what our insid and potenti custom have
told us. (keep send me your comment.) we have been de-emphas
run microsoft window program becaus mani of you told us you
detest spend hundr of dollar on individu softwar program,
forc upgrad and activ code. it's not just the oper
system, but costli microsoft program you're want to avoid. 

consequ, we've been emphas click-n-run becaus it will chang
the wai you think about softwar. have a neatli categor librari
  of 1,000+ softwar titl all for a
flat annual fee at your digit fingertip is an entir new wai to
think about pai for softwar. it's immedi, eleg and afford.

there ar lot of mischaracter about lindow.com swirl around
- which happen when you have a small organ which can't address
everi question or public. we'll do a better job of address these
in the futur. for now, i wrote up answer to the top myth about
lindow.com. check them out by visit: www.lindow.com/myth  grade:
