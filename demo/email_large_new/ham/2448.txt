[webdev] mod_rewrit question i'm try to wrap zope up behind apach, so i can do virtualhost for
zope.

 i've a site on http://ip:8080/mysit.

 i want that to appear as http://mysit.com/ - so:


        servernam mysit.com
        documentroot /var/www/mysit
        rewriteengin                   on
        rewriterul     ^/(.*)    http://localhost:8080/mysit/$1 [p]


 now, what happen is that apach grab http://localhost:8080/mysit/ and spit
it out to the browser. love. all work.

 except for frame page (like zope's manag interfac). it end up
look like:

    







 and of cours, that's not what my client should go to. ani idea what i'm
do wrong ?

kate
