(what's your budget and what countri do you live in?)

openprint.org ha a by-manufactur list group all the 
"perfectli" work printer togeth, then the "mostli" then the 
"partial" and "paperweight".

for exampl:
http://www.openprint.org/printer/manufactur/epson/
http://www.openprint.org/printer/manufactur/fujitsu/
http://www.openprint.org/printer/manufactur/hp
http://www.openprint.org/printer/manufactur/dell

even though it's mark as "mostli", i realli like my dell 3100cn 
color laser printer.  it's *big*, and wa $350 about 5 year ago but 
be laser printer is toner-base, and powder doesn't dry out.
