hello=2c

i wa hope to get some feedback or tip on how to setup a pci serial card=
 (not onboard) for kernel messag log captur. i am us debian lenni x6=
4 with the grub2 bootload.

thi might sound like an easi question=2c but doe the linux kernel modul =
have to be compil with the run kernel in order to log messag at boo=
t time? i mean obvious the driver is requir to be load in debian gnu/=
linux when the serial/com devic is us in conjunct
with /dev/ttyd[01].

i have found a websit provid patch for the chip on the pci serial car=
d i am us at:
http://izto.org/mc9865/

doe debian not includ driver for serial card in ani packag or would t=
hese driver be consid non-free?

thank.
