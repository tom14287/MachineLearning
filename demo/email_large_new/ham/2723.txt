all the stuff at debian-multimedia can't be includ in debian for
variou reason, mostli freedom i think, so you won't find it in debian
at all. it's made for debian but it isn't debian.

i start us d-mm.o from the repli to a question i post in thi
list mani year ago and i suspect most peopl still find it todai the
same wai.
