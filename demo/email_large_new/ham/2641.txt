i see noth about the failur. all seem to go fine, postfix 
establish a connect with remot server and silent fail :-/

put postfix into a more verbos log. in "main.cf":

***
debug_peer_level = 2
debug_peer_list = newserv
***

reload postfix and try again.

p.s. 1 - check the more basic here: saslauth mechan be us for 
authent and of cours, a correct password in "/etc/postfix/
sasl_passwd" o:-)

p.s. 2 - rememb that "535 5.7.3 authent unsuccess" is a 
messag come from exchang server -not postfix- so it would be great if 
you could review the log from the ms server side.
