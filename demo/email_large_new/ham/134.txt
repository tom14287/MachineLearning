would you happen to have ani link to such benchmark, unoffici or
otherwis?

my experi ha been that whenev i look at filesystem benchmark,
thei skip the mani-small-file case.  i've alwai had the feel that
most of the big filesystem care a lot about scale up in file-size,
but not too much about anyth els.

i'm a reiser3 user myself, and i've never had ani problem with it.

(the troubl with it be "long in the tooth" is mostli hypothet,
isn't it?)
