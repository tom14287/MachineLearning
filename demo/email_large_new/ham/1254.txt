actual, i person have not. howev, thi wa actual the design
goal of qt4 and mani user have test and report lower memori usag
in kde 4 compar to kde 3. i don't know about cpu, though.

also, the last time i ran kde 3.5.10 it felt wa notic lag
compar to my then-current kde 4.3 setup on the same hardwar. note
that the kde 4.3 even had quit a few other app instal, and the
kde 3.5.10 wa a new instal that i did to triag a possibl
regress.

like i said, though, if you need qt3 librari in addit to qt4 (for
quanta, for instanc) then you will be us the memori of _both_,
natur, and that is a lot!
