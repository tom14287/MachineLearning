i got the dsl-w 906e from http://www.dsl-warehous.co.uk.

though it's not at all the best on around i have to sai it doe the job
and a bit. some of the featur can be a pain to get work (ie. pptp in
pppoe mode - can't figur it out). the document is not the best, but
the gui from http://www.dsl-warehous.co.uk will help you ouit. thei
also have a messag board.

the command line interfac is quit power, but absolut not
userfriendli.

all in all it's a cheap desent perform, that i am happi enough with.
got thi on includ a microfilt (not need) for 140euro includ
ship. better than ani deal from eircom.
