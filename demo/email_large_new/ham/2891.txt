re: don't be too quick to assum that -xx:+usecompressedoop is a
 good thingcan you post some detail? i haven't done ani seriou benchmark, but i haven't seen a scenario where someth 'seem' significantli slower, and in all case i've tri (gui applic and j2ee applic) the memori footprint wa significantli smaller). i imagin a codebas that would not benefit much from compress oop would be on reli primarili on manipul primit data type, but in that scenario i don't see how perform would be impact. i'd love to see your data, and if anyon ha some insight on the potenti perform tradeoff with compress oop, pleas share!
