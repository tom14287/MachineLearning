debian-style task-packag for rh8.0 availablehi,

thi ha been hash over a few time on variou list, now i final got 
around to do someth about it... you can now add
"rpm http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/ redhat/8.0 task" to your sourc.list 
and after apt-get updat you can find out what's avail with 
'apt-cach search ^task-'

these ar gener directli from comp.xml of rh8.0 so thei contain 
exactli the same packag as you'll get by choos the variou categori 
at instal time. i didn't bother includ srpm for these as thei ar 
rather uninterest, if you want you can re-gener the .spec by 
run http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comp2task/comp2task.py.

btw the repositori onli contain the task-packag, you'll need an 
apt-enabl mirror of rh8.0 in your sourc.list to actual do anyth 
with it.
