lisi,

thi is not realli an answer to your question, but rather
an altern, especi sinc you ar short of time.
both yahoo and mapquest have aerial photo avail, down
to fairli decent resolut in most area.  i can clearli
pick out my hous on a 60'x120' lot us it.  it mai be
adequ for your purpos.  and in public place, such
as the capitol build, i can pick out individu peopl,
though i obvious can't tell who thei ar.  try, for exampl,

   http://www.mapquest.com/

to see actual photograph, click on "aerial map" in the
upper right hand corner.  by default, it show street name
too, but you can turn that off by click off the check
box for "show label".  the zoom control is in the upper
left-hand corner of the pictur.
