i am not familiar with those set in linux. so i did some search.
http://wiki.debian.org/debiandesktophowto

which sai:
"thi is a problem with the wai d-bu figur out what group you ar
a member of. all user should be ad to plugdev, netdev, and
option powerdev, in /etc/group. ani wai of autom thi in
debian?"

i look around in /etc/ and find there ar 2 group file.

mobildebian:/etc# nano group
group   group-

im guess i need to remov group [ which is empti ] and renam
group- to be the group file.

correct?
