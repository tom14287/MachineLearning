it is base on the fact that the 'offici instal' overwrit file
belong to debian packag.  when those packag somedai get upgrad,
thei overwrit what the nvidia driver instal, and then thing break.
i have help enough peopl fix that kind of mess to know.

just a simpl fact.  overwrit packag own by a packag is alwai
a bad idea no matter how it is done, becaus somedai the packag will
overwrit it back on you.

linux-imag-2.6-x is not updat right awai unfortun in the case
of unstabl (and sometim test).  it should alwai be up to date in
stabl though.  i have never quit figur out how the kernel packag
decid when to updat it.

it simpli come down to the fact that us the nvidia instal
overwrit packag file and that is "a bad thing"(tm).

well i am think of try to come up with a method that actual make
it try to compil the modul if it is miss at boot.  my wife thought
it wa rather unfriendli that her last upgrad (which gave her a new
kernel) took awai x.  sure recompil the modul with modul-assist
wa easi, but it had to be done manual.  i will see if i can't find
a wai to autom that for those user that want it.

sometim it doe. :)

also the nvidia instal for a long time hasn't work with debian's
2.6.29 and higher kernel becaus thei ar now kbuild onli (and henc
don't allow compil test that the nvidia instal us to work unless
thei get convert to kbuild).  i am not sure if it work with it yet.
those run their own kernel would of cours never notic that problem
sinc thei have the full sourc instal the wai the nvidia makefil
assum it would be.  thi same kernel header chang also turn vmware
modul into a nightmar as well as a few other out of kernel driver.
