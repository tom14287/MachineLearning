i believ that's just a matter of string pars. if someon were to fix
the openssh packag, remov the explicit requir:, i believ the
automag binari handler would figur the right librari to us and
instal. i haven't met an openssh like that and in worst case i've had 3
differ openssl librari (wtf can't thei just bump a major version if
it's incompat?!?).
