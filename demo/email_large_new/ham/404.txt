there ar sever issu here.

(1) for reason that have noth to do with
commerci advertis, we need email softwar that
prevent viru attack a la melissa and klez. we
simpli can't continu down the path where everi
script kiddi with a grudg or polit agenda can
caus million or billion of dollar worth of
damag.

(2) veri like, email practic will evolv to the
point that digit signatur ar the standard wai
to recogn the sender of a messag. sabotag
your machin or otherwis compromis your privat
kei will be the onli wai that someon can forg a
messag from you. i don't see ani reason that email
softwar that automat us digit signatur
for contact manag and whitelist would be
ani more expens than exist email client.
unless microsoft manag to get a defacto monopoli
on it.

(3) i think ident theft should be made a feloni,
with veri stiff penalti, for reason that have
noth to do with spam. no, obvious, simpli
parad around with a sign that sai "i'm georg
bush" is not ident theft. on the other hand,
i think us a viru to compromis someon els's
privat kei should should fall into that categori.
