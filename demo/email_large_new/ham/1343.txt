hacker and cracker respect onli on thing: strong secur. keep the bad gui out of your pc or network with the advanc technolog that's trust by million: zonealarm pro 3.0. thi best-in-class person firewal stop hacker cold, defend your onlin privaci,and set up in minut. click here to download now!



well, it's been half a week sinc we releas it, and we're still
get record download for our first
free gnometom. what doe
that mean? simpl. download all you want - we'll definit make
more. in fact, we've found a wai to get your product and servic
a littl bit of unlimit promot on the side, too. and who
couldn't us a littl more traffic nowadai? well, unless your
data transfer bill is alreadi sky high (which can happen when you
get featur). it's all fun and game until someon's server fall
to it knee. we're still sit
at #5 on amazon. if we ever
hit #1, i'll eat my hat. and, mind you, thi hat ha been sit
around for quit a while; it smell like feet. you'd have to eat
three sombrero just to get the same amount of nutrit you'd get
from my hat. you're better off just go for the free stuff, i
suppos. the next time thei ask: "do you care to super size that?"
you can respond, with digniti: "my fund ar suffici for the
upgrad; i avoid spend monei on someth that would have
last longer, support a help caus, and not have kill me
earlier." it make sens - if you think about it. the fri aren't
go to eat themselv. and if you don't eat the fri, who will?



put your hunger asid for just a moment. it's time for a paragraph
i like to call: "why you shouldn't sign up for directdsl." thei
went out of their wai to send me an unsolicit e-mail thi
even. now, i know what you're think: "how kind of them,
chri. you were just ask about dsl provid in yesterdai's
issu. thei must have read your mind!" no, thei must have rent a
list of address which weren't confirm. but the fun didn't stop
there. i receiv a messag about directtv from yet anoth
market compani. their effort wa inde caught by thi crafti
ey, and my monei will be divert to other (less-spammish)
busi in the futur. it's my "direct" wai of sai: you're
not the onli game in town. anybodi els care to test my patienc?
i didn't think so. my blacklist get share with 250,000 peopl
from around the world. oop! my inbox just got slam with more
junk; look like lyco will never get anoth click from me,
either. see what you get when you tempt fate?



my good buddi, bill,
tell me that speakeasi.net
provid great dsl connect. he'll even get the credit if i
sign up through hi affili link! paul how agre with him,
too: "static ip ar the norm, thei do not us pppoe, and thei
encourag peopl to run server on their dsl connect. when
look at their packag, i suggest you look at the 'home
servic' page. thei even have adsl up to 1.5m downstream / 768k
upstream, which i have not seen from ani other provid. and that
is less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start
look at the price of a 768k sdsl line!" and stuart portner is
chock full of common sens: "rememb that a lot of dsl provid
give you the modem for free and prefer that you us their - at
least for initi setup / shakedown period." all the more fri
for me, dude!




see you in august,              chri pirillo

compani overview v1.3 [389k] w9x/2k/xp free

http://www.toteboard.net/model/compani_overview.htm


{check your stock} when you're do long-term invest, the
best thing to do with your monei is to invest and then "forget
about it." our gnomi buddi brian steven is the type of gui that
like to plai the stock market. he's alwai log into e*trade
and check on hi stock. that's a lot of work! we told him to
forget about it and let compani overview do the work. thi excel
spreadsheet and add-in is a great wai to check stock and save the
data into a separ excel spreadsheet. brian sai, "e*trade
doesn't give me half the inform that compani overview doe,
such as insid trade and financi trend, along with mani other
tidbit of inform." note: you must us excel 2000 or higher
for the spreadsheet to oper correctli.


flexibl renam v5.2.0 [426k] w9x/2k/xp free

http://hp.vector.co.jp/author/va014830/english/flexrena/


{renam your file} i work with a lot of file throughout the dai,
and sometim i end up with a desktop clutter with useless
copi and shortcut - and you know how i feel about clutter. i
don't need a remind that there ar five shortcut or six copi
of someth on my desktop... and that is where flexibl renam
come into the pictur. with flexibl renam, i can cut off the
"shortcut to" and "copi of" prefix from all my file, make
them a lot easier to read. that's not all though... you can even
make a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in second.
if you don't like your filenam in all cap, then just switch them
to lower case and vice-versa. the possibl ar endless! (you
know, i alwai want to chang my own name from "chri" to
"caspian wildflow"...)

{restor delet file} have you ever delet a file from your pc,

the dai. (yai!) with disk investig, i can view delet file

wonder if i fulli delet a troublesom file... i just load up
disk investig, and i'll know if the file is gone (with 100%

actual titl button 1.3 [1.0m] w9x/2k/xp $19.95
    unearth by michael tretyakov

http://www.actualtool.com/


{window explor add-on} "actual titl button let you add the
new minim to trai and stai on top button to ani program's
titl bar next to the window standard minim/maxim/close
button." thi program is a must for anyon who want to avoid the
distract of other window pop up over your activ window.
while write thi review, i am us the "stai on top" command
for notepad, and dure thi time i have alreadi receiv five
instant messag. why is thi import? normal these messag
would pop up in front of notepad and disrupt my work... but with
actual titl button, i can keep type without miss those
"import" instant messag. the onli differ is that thei
aren't an annoy now. the "minim to trai" featur is great,
too, becaus free up taskbar space is a beauti thing...
especi when you don't have to close down your program to do
it.

i just hate it when i try to instal a program and the
instal fail. i hate it even more when the program doesn't
leav a log file to help me track down the problem. some would sai
i am out of luck, but as long as the program us window
instal, then i am on cloud nine. why am i so happi? becaus for
ani program that us window instal, i can turn on log
through the registri. navig to hkei_local_machin \ softwar \
polici \ microsoft \ window \ instal. add a new string
valu, doubl-click it, and enter the follow valu data:
"voicewarmup" (san quot). these letter can be enter in ani
order: v = verbos output; o = out- of-disk-space messag; i =
statu messag; c = initi ui paramet; e = all error
messag; w = non-fatal warn; a = start up of action; r =
action-specif record; m = out-of- memori or fatal exit
inform; u = user request; p = termin properti. if you
add a plu, the exist file will be append. if you add an
exclam mark, each line is flush. now, when someth fail,
i just have to check in the "temp" directori and look for my log
file. thei'll vari in name, but will alwai start with "msi" and
end with the .log extens. as alwai, make sure to backup your
registri befor make ani modif.
