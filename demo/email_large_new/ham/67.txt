[ilug] gargnom & sawfish.. i decid to try out gargnom, to see what gnome2 look like. it's
pretti, i'll give it that.

 howev, there seem to be load of bug - sawfish threw wobbler all
over the place, so i try out metac - which doesn't have a gui
configur, and ars if i'm go back to the fvwm dai when you had to
set set by hand, without an idea what the valu look like.

 so, i went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish can't start applet (ye, i did
chang the ld_librari_path back) and the panel can't make new workspac.

 ani idea what could have happen ? would sawfish 2.0 silent chang
the config file & break them?
