well, that make the imag slightli smaller, but i still get a blank
page between everi print page.

further test lead me to believ that thi problem is driver-specif.
when i print to anoth printer, an ibm proprint ii, i do not have
thi problem.  i see that in lenni the ghostscript pj driver is us
and in squeez thei have switch to the hpli driver.  perhap upgrad
to squeez mai fix the problem.  in the meantim, i'm go to do some
experi with the ghostscript driver directli and see what i can
see.
