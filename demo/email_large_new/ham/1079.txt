but the kei is restart the x server, not necessarili a logout and
login to the gnome desktop.  a login/logout sequenc is simpli the most
common wai to restart the x server.  the x server can onli start onc

of the old instanc of the server will get termin.  ha anyon seen
someth like thi on a non-nvidia driver (not nv and not nvidia)?
