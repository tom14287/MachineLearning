the "best" wai to acheiv thi would be to us lvm abov your softwar
raid. at that point, it would be veri painless, compar to what is
ahead of you now. if you're curiou, here would be the step:

mdadm -c /dev/md0 -n 2 -l 1 -a ye /dev/sd{a,b}
pvcreat /dev/md0
vgcreat home /dev/md0
lvcreat -l 1g -n swap home
lvcreat -l 10g -n root home
lvcreat -l 100%free -n home home

then, for give more space to home, and less to root, boot off a live
cd, and (assum you're us ext3/4):

e2fsck /dev/home/root
resiz2fs /dev/home/root 6g
lvreduc -l 6g /dev/home/root
lvextend -l +4g /dev/home/home
resiz2fs /dev/home/home

that's it! howev, becaus you chose not to us lvm, you will need to
boot of a live cd that support linux softwar raid, rebuild the arrai,
and perform the resiz there. i'm not sure if gpart support thi or
not. worth check out, howev.

i would person recommend back up your data, and reinstal,
with lvm on top of your softwar raid. you still have the redund,
and you have the awesom flexibl of resiz volum with great eas.=
