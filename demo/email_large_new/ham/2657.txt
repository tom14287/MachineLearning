conor - it's a rather larg contin - peopl might need to know where you
ar go to suggest sourc. and if you're bui abroad, make sure you get
to test it - mani place won't have facil for you to do that.

ani monitor should just work - thei all have vga connector and ani half
decent brand will be know about by xfree setup program in modern
distribut. howev, if you have the budget (insur pai for the
dead monitor, perhap ? - and where wa your monitor that it got caught in a
flood ?) get a monitor with a dvi input is best. of cours, you'll need
a dvi out video card then, too. dvi provid a much better pictur than vga
becaus it remov the analog stage - basic dvi give you a direct
connect from video ram pixel to monitor pixel - the best pictur i've
ever seen on a comput is on my notebook screen at 1400x1050 (which doesn't
us dvi, but an intern connect which ha the same effect). brand wise,
i like iiyama a lot and i think thei mai have a europ wide warranti.
