"licens" and/or patent ar veri import if you want to distribut 
your work and w3c should care about recommend a technolog or 
specif that mai have a non-clear licens or make us of hidden 
patend softwar.

what i want to sai is that in the event i had to choos a format for 
deliv my work, i -for sure- wouldn't go for flash, although adob 
claim is "open".

otoh, as mani other have point out, flash format mayb now open, but 
"player" ar still in a veri bad shape (and i am not talk about gnash/
swfdec, but adob's own flash player for linux). it's crappi and buggi.

so the realiti is that anyon want to view a flash base site ha to 
have adob flash player instal as is the onli on abl to fulli 
support all the featur list in their "open" spec.

and the same situat goe for adob reader for linux. i dunno what is 
go on with adob but true is that i dislik the path is take that 
compani :-/
