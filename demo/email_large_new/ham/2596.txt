enough to frequent the java-dev list would be awar thei can do thi? is =
there an offici appl prefer for either plugin or would the =
default set just de facto be that? is there ani wai to provid 3rd =
parti access to java prefer set?

i wouldn't suggest put ani time into engin a java-specif =
switch which is onli go to be us by an audienc of develop, who =
can follow step on a wiki until mozilla is readi to make the switch for =
all of their custom. i think the plan is to just cut over complet =
to plugin2 and drop support for the jep at some point (and we had to =
ship updat 2 & 7 with the plugin2 symlink present in /librari/internet =
plug-in to make that a possibl). but realli someon from mozilla =
would be best to comment on how and when thei ar plan to do what.

i don't believ it make sens for appl to sai which plugin "should be =
the default for all browser". plugin1 is simpli the default for safari =
for now (and will like remain the default forev on leopard). chrome =
never bother to implement a compat hack to load plugin1, and =
simpli did without java support until appl ship an npapi plugin2 =
that could render cooper via coregraph, and didn't us an =
overlai window.

obvious, plugin2 is a continu work in progress that ha sever =
more technic challeng ahead (like interleav hardwar acceler =
draw), will like requir chang to browser (like adopt =
coreanim-npapi draw model), 3rd parti librari (like jogl), and =
will probabl provid a tier user experi base on which browser =
support which draw model, event model, and other featur. we ar =
also still iter on the user experi of how to handl applet =
that open their own window and dialog that ar in a differ process =
from the browser.

current, we don't have ani store set which track the switch =
between plugin1 or plugin2. the state of the java prefer ui is =
actual just built from the presenc or non-presenc of the =
javaplugincocoa.bundl symlink. in a futur releas when we make plugin2 =
the default for safari, we'll simpli delet the javaplugincocoa.bundl =
in /librari/internet plug-in (which we know mozilla doe not us), and =
alter java prefer to write out a symlink to ~/librari/internet =
plug-in instead, so the chang is onli scope to the user. at least =
that's the current plan, and it could chang, but it's the best idea =
we've got so far.

i hope thi provid some perspect on where we'd like to go with =
plugin2,
