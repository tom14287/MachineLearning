john robb ha an interest perspect on trust-base, target advertis
[1] base on hi experi at gomez dure the headi dai of the internet 
gold rush. 

nobodi believ advertis[2] ani more. there's a lot of evid that 
advertis just doesn't work, no matter how target, so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choic but to get into the editori side, where 
consum' defens ar lower. product placement ar on exampl of thi. 

there is an unfortun tragedi of the common, here. when advertis first 
rose to promin, advertis _did_ work. we hadn't built up our 
immun yet. as more and more advertis us the opportun of the medium 
to lie, we learn not to trust advertis. but we still trust editori. 
and onc editori get pollut by desper market us pr instead 
of advertis to promot their messag, nobodi will believ it either.
