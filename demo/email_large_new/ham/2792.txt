subject: [camram-spam] anoth framework hashcash relat framework

there is a framework for us a hashcash like proof of work function
as a wai to frustrat junk mailer in thi paper:

"curb junk e-mail via secur classif"

by e. gabber, m. jakobsson, y. matia, a. mayer bell

in fc98.

onlin copi here:

http://cites.nj.nec.com/27735.html

(look in the view or download section at the top right, it's
availabil in at least .pdf and .ps format).

the framework thei propos with proxi etc look a lot like the
current camram architectur, with a proof of work to get on a white
list.  thei us target revok email address (basic ident
to the lwpa concept) to implement the white list.

the result framework is essenti ident to what i propos in
recent messag with:

subject: target revok email address, and postag-free token

their idea of includ the postag free-token in the email address,
mirror what is done in lwpa and make the system exhibit smoother
migrat for non-user.  eg. you can us vari sender address and
it will still work, you can forward the email address to someon els
and it will still work etc.

thei have some softwar architectur diagram and suggest for
instal some of the proxi on a corpor gatewai -- "gatekeep"
thei call it.
