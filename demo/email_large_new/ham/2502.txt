except that most technic peopl would probabl rather hammer a nail
through their forehead than go through the pain of su someon and
deal with the legal system, the paper work, the time involv ...

so look for a technic solut, even on that requir an
enorm amount of develop time, make sens.  mayb the
develop time is actual a bonu, if you're interest in that
sort of tinker alreadi.

all of that be said - thi entir thread is realli a question of
secur, and secur is a process and an approach, not an end result.
there is no such thing as a 100% secur system that is also us, in
the same wai that there is no such thing as a 100% secur pdf that is
also us.  so the real goal is to make the document "secur enough"
for on's purpos, while also make the document "usabl enough" for
those purpos.  i think there have been a lot of good idea on thi
thread for manag that trade-off.
