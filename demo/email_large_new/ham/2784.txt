i reran the experi (with the new spamham1.pik, but it doesn't seem
to make a differ).  here ar the clue for the two spam in my
inbox (in hammi.py's output format, which sort the clue by
probabl; the first two number ar the messag number and overal
probabl; then line-fold):

    'economi"': 0.99

thi ha 6 content-type as spam clue, onli on of which is relat
to html, despit there be an html altern (and 12 other spam
clue, vs. onli 6 ham clue).  thi wa an announc of a public
event by our build owner, with a text part that wa the same as
the html (afaict).  it languag mai be spammish, but the content-type
clue didn't help.  (btw, it make me wonder about the wisdom of
keep punctuat -- 'economi' and 'economi"' to me don't seem to
deserv two be count as clue.)

here is the full messag (receiv: header strip), with apolog
to ziggi and david:

content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
content-disposit: inlin
user-agent: mutt/1.4i

i've been look into hotel.  i poke around expedia for avail
from march 26 to 29 (4 night, wednesdai thorugh saturdai).  

i've also start contact hotel for group rate; some of the group
rate ar no better than the regular rate, and thei requir sign a
contract with a minimum number of room sold (with someon financi
respons for unbook room).  most hotel ar less than respons...

	radiss - barcelo hotel (dupont circl)
	$125/night, $99/weekend

	state plaza hotel (foggi bottom; near gwu)
	$119/night, $99/weekend

	hilton silver spring (near metro, in suburban md)
	$99/hight, $74/weekend

	windsor park hotel
	conn av, between dupont circl/woodlei park metro station
	$95/night; need a car

	econo lodg alexandria (near metro, in suburban va)
	$95/night

thi is a hand pick list; i ignor anyth over $125/night, even
though there ar some realli well situat hotel nearbi at higher rate.
also, i'm not sure how much these price reflect an expedia-onli
discount.  i can't vouch for ani of these hotel, either.

i also found out that the down season for dc hotel ar mid-june through
mid-septemb, and mid-novemb through mid-januari.

thi on ha no mime structur nor html!  it even ha a
content-disposit which is count as a non-spam clue.  it got
f-p'ed becaus of the mani hospit-relat and monei-relat
term.  i'm surpris $125/night and similar aren't clue too.  (and
again, sever spam clue ar duplic with differ variat:
'hotel', 'hotel', 'hotel.', 'subject:hotel', 'rate,', 'rate.'.

i also look in more detail at some f-p's in my geek traffic.  the
first on's a doozi (that's the term, right? :-).  it ha lot of
html clue that ar appar ignor.  it wa a multipart/mix with
two part: a brief text/plain part contain on or two sentenc, a
mondo weird url:

http://x60.deja.com/[st_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?an=687715863&context;=973121507.1408827441&hitnum;=23

and some employ-gener spammish boilerpl; the second part wa
the html taken directli from the abov url.  clue:
