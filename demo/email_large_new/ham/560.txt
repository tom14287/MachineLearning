if what you sai is true, then he is wast hi time (and our) by post
to *ani* list.  if he can
onli receiv e-mail from fellow cuban, then even if there ar fellow
cuban who could help him and ar subscrib to the list, thei will never
receiv hi post, sinc the list server is outsid of cuba.  in fact,
no-on in cuba could even subscrib to the list, sinc thei will never
receiv the confirm e-mail.  and if thei don't have web access
either, then post to *ani* list is an exercis in futil for cuban.
list ar black hole to cuban.  everyth goe in, noth come out.
appar he hasn't figur that out yet.
