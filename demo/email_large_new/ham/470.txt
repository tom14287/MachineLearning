i assum he had done that (it's what i ask him to do), in which
case the report behaviour indic someth odd go on. of
cours, the xev output he post came from the mous leav the xev
window, so mayb you're right and he misunderstood the instruct.

so, to make it even clearer: move the xev window if necessari so it
doesn't cover the termin window. middl click in it, prefer
without move the mous, even a littl. you should now see the mous
click event in the termin window. the moment you move the mous,
ton of movement event will roll in and scroll the click event right
out of the termin window.
