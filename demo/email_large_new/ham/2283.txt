easi.

first, you'll have to excus me as i'm still us 2.3.1 (*), so, thi
mai not plai well with recent chang.  (i did look at 2.5.1, too).
and, i just did thi off the top of my head (i want to see if it
(**) still work), so thi is somewhat untest.

ad a menu entri is trivial; add thi to your ~/.exmh/exmh-default:

*fop.more.m.uentrylist:	ketchup
*fop.more.m.l_ketchup:		catch-up all b4 cur
*fop.more.m.c_ketchup:	 	my_mark2curseen

then you just need to provid the sourc for my_mark2curseen and 
arrang for exmh to includ it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directori
in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enabl the "sourc hook"
under pref->hack support)

it's go to look someth like thi:

proc my_mark2curseen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    exmh_statu "clear unseen up to cur..." red
    mh_setcur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set pick(id) [...get messag id for "pick 1-cur"...]
    busi pickmarkseen
    exmh_statu ok blue
}

(that's base upon the gut of pick_markseen)

you need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; i ran out of
time!
