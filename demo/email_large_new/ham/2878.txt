hi,

when compil ani .tex document us the rout latex -> dvip ->
ps2pdf, i get a pdf. normal, but the problem is that if i the pdf is
alreadi open (e.g. becaus i wa read the version of the document
befor have modifi and compil it) when the compil and the
whole process end, the open pdf is blank, i.e. the current page
becom white, and everi page i go at is white. if i then re-open the
document, i find the new version of my pdf.

i would like to know how thi process actual work. for me, it look
like the ps2pdf tool creat the pdf from scratch, and overwrit the
old pdf. but why am i receiv no warn messag from acroread?
anywai, acroread seem not to be lock the file, or, if so, ps2pdf
forc the write.

thank.
