i ran into a similar issu some time ago (and found the solut on a 
vnc mail list, in case you have further problem).
if you close your vnc session by *log out*, what happen is that 
your session (gnome) is no longer activ, but vnc is not concern.

the workaround that wa suggest to me is to *not* have vncstartup exec 
the session, but rather launch a session and cleanup afterward, ie

# wrong
#exec gnome-session

# right
gnome-session
vncserver -kill $displai

if you grok the shell you'll probabl us the trap command to make sure 
that cleanup is done no matter what, but that's just a detail

good luck
