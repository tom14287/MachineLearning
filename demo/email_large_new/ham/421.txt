if it weren't for the live migrat requir, i read thi to sai that
googl would be us xf due to it superior perform:

"in a mail list post, googl engin michael rubin provid more insight
into the decis-make process that led the compani to adopt ext4. the
filesystem offer signific perform advantag over ext2 _and nearli
rival the high-perform xf filesystem_ dure the compani's test.
ext4 wa ultim chosen over xf becaus it would allow googl to do a
live in-place upgrad of it exist ext2 filesystem."
