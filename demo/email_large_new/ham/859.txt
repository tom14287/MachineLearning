so, as you alreadi discard flashplay as uniqu sourc of your 
reboot, i will take a look into:

1/ system overh (reboot tend to happen due to high temperatur, 
watch the bio cpu temp and control the rpm of the fan).

2/ ram memori modul and voltag. check the ram dimm ar certifi for 
you motherboard and also, look into the bio voltag ar the correct 
on for you type of ram.

3/ hard disk health. you can test thi with "smartcl".

be a brand-new comput i would suspect for bad hardwar or assembl 
problem :-/
