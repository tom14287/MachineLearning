re: benjamin wallac higginscongratul!!

a few observ:

all children ar differ and will gener rout around whatev 
techniqu you learn from rel, book, talk show, or the last child.

just when you get good at be a parent, you're done.

don't overprotect. i alwai call thi "first babi syndrom". a 
neighbor at on point had a 4 or 5 year old that would choke on jello, 
probabl becaus she never allow him to have solid food until he wa 
far too old, imho. i fed mine cereal, etc., earli and let them get the 
hang of it. i alwai want my kid to be abl to handl anyth if i'm 
not there so i have them try it out when i am. (within limit of 
cours.) of cours, i'm now beat up my bodi at van skate park try 
to do 5ft. half pipe on speed skate with my 10 year old daughter.
