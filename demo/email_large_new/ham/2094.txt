  your messag initi didn't have that link; so thank for provid
 it.

  i think i over-react becaus i'm us to see peopl give
 list of alleg problem in softwar, but without enough detail to
 allow anybodi els to confirm them, or investig.
 sometim you'll get lucki and somebodi els will report it; but post
 to the user mail list thing like:

    * i us softwar xx but it is buggi and now i us someth els

  just feel like a random rant, not the start of a us or product
 discuss.  (which is pretti much what you did.)

  inde.  still if it affect on site it probabl affect other,
 unless it is caus by a particularli malform
 html/javascript/whatev that site us behind the scene.

  on that basi it us to report, if onli so that other user
 of that particular site can see it.

  even without that perhap save the page, and associ media
 to your local machin might still trigger it. if that is the case you
 can trim down the page(s) a lot and see if you can find out what caus
 it yourself.  (assum you're familiar with html & so on.)
