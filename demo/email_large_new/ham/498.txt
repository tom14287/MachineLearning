assum you talk about thi charact: Â², which is unicod u+00b2, or 
superscript two, just map your keyboard to do that for you. for exampl 
for assign the combin altgr-2 (altgr is the right-alt, if not 
mark as such):

xmodmap -e "keycod 0x0b =  2 at 0x010000b2"

to autom thi add that line in your .xsession or .xinitrc.
for mani chang to the keyboard make your own .xmodmap file
and add xmodmap .xmodmap in your .xsession or .xinitrc file.

best regard,
