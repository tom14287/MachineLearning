what releas of debian ar you us?  lenni?  squeez?  sid?

i've experienc what you describ befor, mainli becaus older releas
of debian us the lpr/lpd print setup, and i us apsfilt to
instal printer driver.  then when i switch to a newer releas of
debian that us cup, and foomat did not have a driver for the printer,
especi for older or less popular printer.

http://www.linuxprint.org and http://www.cup.org ar good place
to start look for document.
