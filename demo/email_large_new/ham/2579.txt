i'm not realli sure if thi is guarate to work on all java =
implement, but you could try to open the file for random access =
(http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/doc/api/java/io/randomaccessfil.html), =
then write random data to the entir content of the file befor you =
delet. it might even work if you first open, then delet, befor =
write random data if you prefer that.=20

but it might be that you ar better off find a command-line tool that =
handl the secur delet for you, and creat a swing app that =
deleg the heavi lift to the command-line tool. low-level file =
system access isn't realli on of java's strong point, as it fouc ha =
alwai been be cross-platform (java 7's nio.2 function might fix =
some of these issu though) .
