i also have been us debian-multimedia for lame mp3 and am veri thank
for it exist.  the file wa a quicktim .mov file thei made with their
own camera and is on their machin so unfortun i cannot get a snippet
of it.

fwiw, i did 2 fresh lenni instal on my friend's machin, the first on
with debian-multimedia which result in the .mov file not plai back in
mplayer, and a subsequ second lenni instal, ident to the first
except without the debian-multimedia, in which the .mov file plai great in
mplayer.  i don't know if it's a bug or not, but ha anyon els had thi
specif problem (with .mov file in mplayer)?  if so i will gladli file the
bug report.  i've read about sever differ bug with mplayer on variou
forum but have not seen thi on specif.

thank you,
mark
