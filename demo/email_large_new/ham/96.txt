3/4 gb. the onli downsid wa that at some point there wa an updat to 
10.5 where my firewir enclosur becam unreli. it seem to affect 
certain id to fw bridg chip in hard drive enclosur and i wa unlucki. 
i can usual power cycl the drive and try again successfulli. it matter 
not which cabl and drive i us, i have three enclosur, and onc is the 
culprit.
