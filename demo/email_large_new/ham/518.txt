uh? no, there ar mani problem come for differ sourc that can 
affect the browser stabil.

javascript (and flash as well as other plugin) can be on of them, sure, 
but disabl it should cure the issu at all. if it doe not, that mean 
the problem can lie somewher (packag error, xul librari or even old 
profil set).

but "close tag and get crash randomli" is not the type of 
behaviour i would associ to a javascript issu becasu javascript code 
should have been render when the page load or when click on item, 
but not at page/tab close :-?
