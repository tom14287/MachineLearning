shouldn't apt-get upgrad, you know, upgrad ?
hi all,

i wa have some problem with ooffic so i did "apt-get updat" and
then ran "apt-get upgrad" to see if ooffic wa among the packag to
be upgrad.  it wasn't, but i tri "apt-get instal ooffic"
anywai, and presto it start upgrad ooffic.

so i look at the man-page:

 upgrad
is us to instal the newest version of all packag current
instal on the system

i did, in fact, have ooffic instal so i'm not clean on why upgrad
alon did seem to want to upgrad the packag.

ani idea ?

thank,

brian
