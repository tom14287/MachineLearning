secur multipl virtual hostsi am try to secur three of four virtual hostnam on our apach server.
we ar not take credit card order or user's person inform, but ar
mere hope to secur email and calendar web transact for our user.
we ar not run ani secur applic on the root host.

i have been test thi week with ca, client, and host certif
request, certif, and kei, and think i have a fairli good beginn's
grasp of the command and command line option.


my question ar:

1.  is it necessari to creat a ca certif for each of the secur
virtual host, or can on ca certif for the root be us to sign each
of the kei for all three common name we ar try to secur?

2.  even though the root host is not conduct secur transact, am i
correct in configur the server with a cacertificatefil in the main bodi
of httpsd.conf and then set the cacertificatefil for each virtual host
in the  section of httpsd.conf?  thi sort of assum the
answer to 1. is  - you need a ca for each virtual host.

3.  is it necessari to creat a client certif to distribut to our
user, or is it suffici to have the ca certif and a server
certif for the virtual host?  wouldn't a client certif onli be
necessari if we were try to verifi the client's ident?  would that be
a good idea given our scenario?

thank in advanc for your help.
