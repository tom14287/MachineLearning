re: asteroid anyon ?with enough warn, you might not even care about try to divert 
the meteor -- you'd divert the earth instead.

i recal read mani year ago about calcul, done separ
both by us and ussr scientist for differ reason, about the
effect of nuclear explos on the moon's mass, and thu it orbit,
and thu also (over time) the earth's path around the sun.

i believ the conclus wa that mild chang in the moon's 
composit would have the effect, over sever year, of chang 
significantli where the earth would be at ani certain futur point. 

voila! no collis -- at least not with the initi threat. and
no need to travel out to anywher near the meteor, either. just
the moon.
