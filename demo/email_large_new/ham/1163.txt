check your local friendli red hat instal:

[root@localhost up2date]# rpm --checksig zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm
zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm: md5 gpg ok

of cours, thi is onli as us as, sai, the gpg kei distribut with 
the kernel tarbal, i.e. if you don't actual bother check the sig 
then you ar open to abus. it's entir possibl that rpm can be 
configur to requir good signatur, but i've not read that part of 
the fine manual just yet.

cheer,
