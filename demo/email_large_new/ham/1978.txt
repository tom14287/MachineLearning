i just have test with lenni and seem to be work fine (connect to 
server → ftp w/login). that creat a new network place i can connect to.

after that, i open the ftp session by provid credenti and copi a 
local file to remot ftp locat and is store fine, no error messag or 
someth that indic the put oper ha fail. 

then, if i connect from anoth dedic ftp client, i can see the new 
file there, so all look good. 

have you test with anoth ftp server?

p.s. afaik, i don't have instal "gvf-fuse".
