mount work for you earlier, so i assum that your user ar all
member of the "plugdev" group alreadi. i would like to see the output
of:

  awk '//,/<\/polici>/' /etc/dbu-1/system.d/hal.conf

it would be interest to know if regular user can mount usb stick
us pmount or pmount-hal on the command line.

afaik, you should not have ani entri in fstab for remov devic
that you want to be handl by kde/gnome/whatev_other_de via the
dbu/hal mechan. in ani case, i would avoid try to mix differ
approach.

i have seen that complaint befor, also for system on which mount
work perfectli for singl-user session, and i am not sure if a
satisfactori solut exist. (i have no need for run multipl kde
session on the same machin, therefor i do not know much about thi
issu.)

well, it is a problem for you right now, so why not try to solv it?
besid, udisk ha the same main develop as hal, so i doubt that it
will be so radic differ that hal know-how will becom useless. i
have plai around a bit with udisk yesterdai, it seem to follow the
same basic concept as hal. afaict, udisk-daemon is simpli an upgrad
version of hald that is special on block devic, as on part of a
more modular approach to hardwar abstract.
