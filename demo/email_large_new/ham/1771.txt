hi sven,

thank for that suggest. i had seen that bug and discount it
becaus the patch is onli effect if smtp_tl_capath is set, and
mine wasn't set. but your mail prompt anoth look, and with both
smtp_tl_capath = /etc/ssl/cert and appli the patch from #287795,
it banish the "certif verif fail" and chang
"untrust tl connect establish" to "trust tl connect
establish".

so that's progress :-)

unfortun it's still fail to authent. from mail.log:
mai  9 21:49:18 rimmer postfix/smtp[8121]: 5de243a66: to=, relai=newserv[newserv-ipaddr]:587, delai=5.5, delai=0.02/0.03/5.4/0, dsn=4.7.3, statu=defer (sasl authent fail; server newserv[newserv-ipaddr] said: 535 5.7.3 authent unsuccess)

thank,
clive
