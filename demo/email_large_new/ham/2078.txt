then thi mai be 6 month or more sinc my guess after 3 beta releas is
that the freez on packag version for inclus in the next stabl
releas (n+1) ha alreadi happen, thu you'll have to wait at least for
red hat linux... n+2 :-)

thi is why (if it doesn't break anyth), i'll mayb releas recent
aspel packag. but to be sure i'll need to do some test ;-)
