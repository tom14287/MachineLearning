i'd had similar problem with iceweasel on lenni when my browser cach
limit wa set to a larg valu.  but thing ar okai after bring it
down (to 20mb).  you might want to try that.

larg cach slow iceweasel down becaus it us these larg databas
of store histori to suggest address in each tab's address bar.  i
also had a zotero databas, which us to worsen thing.
