=46irst you need a (basic) regular express (bre) that match "\paragrap=
h{}". =20
the '\' is a bre special charact, so it need to be escap.  also, the "=
{}"=20
is a bit troublesom with find/-exec, so we will match it us the constru=
ct=20
"[{][}]".

the definit document for regular express is the singl unix=20
specif, version 3 -- base definit, chapter 9.  i don't actual=
=20
like (man 7 regex) for thi.

thi give us the regex "\\paragraph[{][}]".  now, we need to get that regu=
lar=20
express to sed.  (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e "s/\\paragraph[{][}]=
//"=20
{} \;) won't work, sinc dure quot remov, on of the '\'s ar drop =
and=20
neither find nor sed "see" it.

the shell doe a *lot* of process to the text you type befor it reach=
=20
the command you ar invok.  singl unix specif, version 3 -- shel=
l=20
and util, chapter 2 is the core document, but some shell ar muc=
h=20
more featur.

we can either us (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e 's/\\paragraph[{][}]//=
'=20
{} \;) or--my prefer--(regex=3d'\\paragraph[{][}]'; find $dir -type f -=
exec=20
sed -i -e "s/$regex//" {} \;) to make sure sed get that import '\'.

also, i left it out, but you mai want the "g" flag to the "s"ubstitut comm=
and=20
in sed.  otherwis, onli on occurr of the regex will get elimin pe=
r=20
line.
